1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,342
Well, well

2
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,552
I have been waiting for you,

3
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:10,845
Horus of Dawn—

4
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:12,388
Or rather,

5
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,600
Miss Takanashi Hoshino

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,229
What do you want this time?

7
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,482
The situation's changed a bit

8
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:24,442
Once more,

9
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:27,445
I have a proposal for you, Hoshino—

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,948
or should I call you
"Abydos' Greatest Mystery?"

11
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,741
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Oh my?

12
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,743
Please calm down

13
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:38,122
I think you'll find my
offer difficult to refuse

14
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,999
(Contract)

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,586
It should be rather enticing, in fact

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,061
(The 177th Abydos Oasis Festival)

17
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:04,399
The sky blue archive!

18
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:17,203
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

19
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:21,457
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

20
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:25,753
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

21
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:29,590
Those clouds like whales are always changing

22
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:33,636
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,017
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
is a taste so divine

24
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:43,271
If I were here alone, here without all of you

25
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:47,317
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,360
A fateful coterie

27
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:57,285
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

28
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:06,252
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

29
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:12,008
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

30
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:22,090
Because this is the only place where we belong

31
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,362
We'll wrap up

32
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,823
with some recent events
from the Abydos District

33
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,785
While there were reports of explosions,

34
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:39,118
(Clear skies!
Expect clouds next week!)

35
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,954
(Clear skies!
Expect clouds next week!)
it's been business as usual
for the desert district

36
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,708
And that's the news for the day!

37
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,627
We'll see you tomorrow!

38
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:57,553
(Shiba Seki Ramen)
(Keep Out)

39
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,557
(Keep Out)
(Danger!)

40
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,067
How did I end up here?

41
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,652
Did you just say something?

42
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,154
Um, Head Prefect?

43
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,074
How much longer do
I have to do this for?

44
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,118
You're at around 200, yes?

45
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,787
Didn't you tell me you
would complete 1,000 pages?

46
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,038
Well, that was⋯

47
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,333
It was a metaphor for my deep remorse⋯!

48
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,544
Use your hands, not your mouth

49
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,379
I-I'll do my best

50
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,008
So, um,

51
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:39,971
are you well-acquainted
with Abydos' Hoshino?

52
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:43,558
No, I just investigated her when
I was on the Intelligence Committee

53
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,935
That was my first time
meeting her in person

54
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,478
I see

55
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:51,357
It's just, you spoke as if you knew her well

56
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,276
Takanashi Hoshino

57
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:56,028
She was hailed as a genius, An elite

58
00:03:56,446 --> 00:04:00,032
The Intelligence Committee's
analysis two years ago identified

59
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,745
her as a potential threat
to Gehenna's security

60
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,415
She didn't give me that impression

61
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,374
Ako

62
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,252
Don't judge a book by its cover

63
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:17,091
But⋯she does seems a bit
different from two years ago

64
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:20,678
She's an aggressive frontliner,

65
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,930
so she was inherently combative in nature,

66
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:27,935
She had a vicious, cutthroat aura

67
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,481
Well, regardless,

68
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,441
if we hadn't retreated then,

69
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:36,903
most of the Prefect Team
would've been incapacitated

70
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,947
Ako, your lack of
preparation is to blame here

71
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,326
I thought my analysis of
their capabilities was flawless,

72
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,077
but I just didn't know⋯

73
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,998
Well, her name did stop appearing
in activity reports out of the blue

74
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:53,127
The Intelligence Committee
deemed her negligible after that

75
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:57,882
If you're curious, dig
through some old records

76
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,677
Ako, you've stopped writing

77
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:02,845
Oh, sorry!

78
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,889
Takanashi Hoshino

79
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,392
I didn't think she'd
still be in Abydos

80
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,150
Um⋯

81
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,694
(An Evil a Day)
Where should I put this?

82
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:25,868
Aru made that with her
esteemed calligraphy talents

83
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,787
Throw it in the trash pile

84
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,705
Are you sure?

85
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,667
It's just something she made
during calligraphy class

86
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:36,420
Well, knowing her, Boss might want it

87
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,174
Aru⋯

88
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:43,010
She's bummed about having to move

89
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,679
I get how she feels,

90
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,139
but the Prefect Team
found out about this place,

91
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:50,226
and our client might come after
us since we failed the job

92
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,853
There's no other choice

93
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,313
Now that you say it,

94
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,817
the way things ended with
Abydos was kinda awkward

95
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:00,319
W-Well, that situation is out of our hands

96
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:03,948
I can hardly attack them after

97
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,534
we fought together, side-by-side!

98
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,744
I see

99
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:11,706
We may be outlaws,
but that's just the proper way⋯

100
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,710
I agree! So let's get moved
out right and proper too!

101
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:20,548
Kayoko, what should
I do with this?

102
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,716
Do you need it?

103
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,260
Of course I do

104
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,970
Just use your cellphone

105
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,347
Convenience is nice, but
this has sentimental value!

106
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,225
- What even is that?
- Look at its antique design!

107
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:33,185
It fits an outlaw's
aesthetic perfectly!

108
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,729
I-I agree!

109
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,523
Because⋯

110
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,443
it's cool

111
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:44,947
As expected of Haruka

112
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,532
This isn't a retreat

113
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,909
We're taking a step back to spring forward

114
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,454
We'll overcome all adversity

115
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,624
and return to this office!

116
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,000
Because

117
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,086
we are true hardboiled outlaws,

118
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,964
Problem Solver 68!

119
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,261
Tomorrow, we say
goodbye to this place

120
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,518
Boss,

121
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,687
the landlord says to leave by today

122
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,190
since we couldn't pay
last month's rent

123
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,275
Aru

124
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,235
Then we're homeless now

125
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,029
Wh-Wh-What⋯

126
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,324
What did you say?!

127
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,751
I've loaded everything

128
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,543
Okay

129
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,005
Cheer up, Aru

130
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,050
It's not our first time
being homeless

131
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:48,594
It's just going back to
our roots for a little bit

132
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,012
Going back⋯

133
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,974
No, no! We're moving forward!

134
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,518
Exactly

135
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,728
Where to now?

136
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:01,190
I mean, there's nowhere else to go,

137
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,067
so back to Gehenna?

138
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,696
Are you leaving?

139
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:09,615
Um⋯

140
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,952
Sunaookami Shiroko, right?

141
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:13,911
Yeah

142
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,163
Wh-What are you doing here?

143
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,541
You can't be looking for another fight!

144
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:19,834
No

145
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,003
I was just riding my bike
in the area and spotted you

146
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,514
U-Um

147
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:36,225
About yesterday⋯

148
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,563
We really owe you

149
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,912
And about the ramen shop⋯

150
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,664
I can't forgive you for that

151
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,710
But you seem remorseful,

152
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,671
so I'll consider it a debt

153
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,800
And you're the ones who
left the bag there, right?

154
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,678
I-I don't know what
you're talking about

155
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,639
We don't know anything
about any bag of money

156
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,267
Never heard of it, never seen it

157
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:22,563
Aru, the way you said "bag of money"

158
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,774
makes it super obvious

159
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,443
Th-That's⋯

160
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,154
You're the ones who stole that
money by robbing the bank

161
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,241
We're not so corrupt as
to keep someone else's spoils

162
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,702
Even hardboiled outlaws
have their principles

163
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,704
Ah, Aru's back

164
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,791
I gave the bag to the master

165
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,959
I see, Thanks

166
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,588
Where will you go?

167
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:53,844
To meet a client who needs
Problem Solver 68's services

168
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,307
Aru, shall we go?

169
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,100
Y-Yeah

170
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:03,312
We need to find somewhere
to sleep tonight

171
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,190
O-Okay

172
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,694
No handshake?

173
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,490
I-I don't do goodbyes

174
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,535
- Because—
- You're an outlaw

175
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:19,954
Will we meet again?

176
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:23,958
Well, if that ramen shop reopens,

177
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,709
maybe we'll see you there

178
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,128
I'll be waiting

179
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,965
Then, it's time to head out!

180
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,259
- Where to?
- We're riding off into the sunset!

181
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,010
It's the afternoon⋯

182
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,471
Anyway, let's go!

183
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,109
Hello

184
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,153
We've come to visit, Master!

185
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,531
How are you feeling?

186
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,450
What're you worrying about?
It's just a few scratches

187
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,036
More importantly, considering
the size of the explosion,

188
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,540
I'm relieved no one else was hurt

189
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,584
Yes, but⋯

190
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,587
- The Shiba Seki Ramen shop⋯
- I know

191
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,464
I'm sorry I can't offer you
a job anymore, Serika

192
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,550
That's hardly the issue here, Master

193
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,843
I'm fine

194
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:19,513
I've been thinking about
closing up shop anyway

195
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:23,809
It's just happening a little
earlier than expected

196
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,728
Closing up?

197
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,315
Yes, I got an eviction notice recently

198
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,942
What do you mean
an eviction notice?

199
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:34,445
Abydos High School owns
the land and buildings

200
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,030
within the Abydos District

201
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,409
Ah, you didn't know

202
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,454
A few years ago, the student council

203
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,206
transferred ownership of
the land to another entity

204
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,667
Even though it's the Abydos District?

205
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,211
Serika, did you know about this?

206
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,089
No, it's the first
I've heard of it

207
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,801
Does that mean there's some other debt
besides the one we're paying off?

208
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,720
I didn't know about this either

209
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,139
Then who owns the buildings now?!

210
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,100
Could it be⋯

211
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,603
Kaiser Corporation?

212
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,857
Something like that⋯

213
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,985
Sorry, I can't remember the details

214
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,324
We need to dig into this more

215
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,826
Ayane, let me help

216
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,371
Me too!
Just say the word

217
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,624
I'm really sorry about this
It's a weird situation

218
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,211
No, it's our problem too

219
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,629
Besides, Master,

220
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,381
don't think about retiring just yet

221
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:38,092
- Got it?
- Ah, okay

222
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,635
Oh, right

223
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,597
Could you pull out the thing
under the bed for me?

224
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,895
Do you recognize this?

225
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,773
- No, well⋯
- I wouldn't say that⋯

226
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,024
This is⋯

227
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:57,611
Really? Shiroko
dropped it off earlier

228
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,572
She said she found it
in front of the exploded shop

229
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:03,701
So I opened it to see what it was⋯

230
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,620
and there was an astonishing
amount of money inside

231
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,373
There must be a story
behind it, right?

232
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,250
I don't think so

233
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,877
Someone with good intentions
must have sent it

234
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:15,004
Right

235
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:19,133
They probably wanted you to
use it to repair Shiba Seki Ramen

236
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,552
Yeah! The people
who left this money

237
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:24,930
must have been moved
by the taste of your ramen!

238
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,057
Is this real life?

239
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,978
If that's the case, I'll have
to repay them with a hot meal

240
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,272
I've kept the shop running all this time

241
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,983
because I wanted to
serve delicious ramen

242
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,861
to hungry customers

243
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,114
Everyone's waiting for
your ramen, Master

244
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:45,326
Get well and reopen
the shop soon, please

245
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,038
And I want my old job
back again, Master

246
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,081
Okay! Don't you worry!

247
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:54,626
When the shop reopens,
you'll be my first customers!

248
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,254
I'll be looking
forward to it!

249
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,137
Hi, Hoshino

250
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,557
Nice weather today
Taking a rooftop nap?

251
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,267
Yeah

252
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,062
Something like that

253
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,147
What about you, Sensei?

254
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,275
I was looking for
somewhere to take a break

255
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,947
It's been a while since
you first came here, huh?

256
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:24,990
Huh?

257
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,785
It has, now that you mention it

258
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:31,246
At first, I thought you
were some weird adult

259
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,956
But I'm pretty reliable, right?

260
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,249
No way

261
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,710
You're clumsy and a bit naive

262
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,296
- But⋯
- Huh?

263
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:43,175
The Foreclosure Task Force kids
seem more lively these days

264
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,968
That's not anything I did,

265
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,597
but rather you all chasing
after the goals that matter to you

266
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,850
You're probably right

267
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,312
Serika's started to rely on others,

268
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:59,274
Ayane's been looking up
more than down lately,

269
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,527
Nonomi has had this big smile

270
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,113
meant for herself rather than others,

271
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,906
and Shiroko⋯

272
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,034
It's like she can breathe again

273
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,247
You're working hard too, Hoshino
Everyone depends on you

274
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:17,960
This old-timer just wants
to protect their youth

275
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,254
That's right

276
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:31,223
So those kids can keep on smiling

277
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,355
To do that, we have to
keep moving forward⋯

278
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,356
Huh?

279
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,859
Nothing, Hearing you
say that makes me

280
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,736
feel free to nap all I want!

281
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,781
Just when I thought we were
having a serious conversation!

282
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,158
How like you!

283
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,083
Good morning, Arona

284
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,378
Eh?

285
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,130
Where's my strawberry bread?

286
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,506
Banana bread?

287
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,177
Am I being punished
for trying to eat both?

288
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,138
- Arona?
- Just one bite, please⋯

289
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,389
Huh, Sensei?!

290
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,600
I'll bring you bread next time

291
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,393
Strawberry and banana

292
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,937
I'm so embarrassed

293
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,064
But thank you!

294
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,608
I'll look forward to it!

295
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,153
Anyway, didja need something?

296
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,697
There's something
that's been bothering me

297
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,783
Could you look into
Kaiser Corporation for me?

298
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,286
Kaiser Corporation?

299
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:38,123
They seem to be up to something
in the Abydos Desert

300
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,791
Understood!

301
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:44,171
Anything else to
investigate while I'm at it?

302
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,632
- About Hoshino's⋯
- Huh?

303
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,593
No, it's nothing

304
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,471
I think that's something
I need to do myself

305
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,309
Because I'm her teacher

306
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,145
Is that so?

307
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,189
Whatever you say, Sensei⋯

308
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,858
Thank you
You're a great help

309
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,527
You can count on me!

310
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,487
After all,

311
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,157
I'm the Shittim Chest's system manager,

312
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,326
main OS,

313
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,538
and, of course, your trusty secretary!

314
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,710
Now then, is everyone here?

315
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,629
Hello, Sensei

316
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,634
Welcome back, everyone!
How is the master?

317
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,512
He's doing well in body and spirit!

318
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:36,473
He plans to reopen
Shiba Seki Ramen soon!

319
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,059
Really? That's great news

320
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,185
Yes

321
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,521
Is something wrong?

322
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,024
There's a new problem actually⋯

323
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,278
We were just about
to discuss it

324
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,196
To cut to the point,

325
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,240
it seems the ownership
of this district

326
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,659
doesn't belong
to Abydos High School

327
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,577
How?!

328
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,580
I thought the school owned
all the land in the district

329
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:04,293
The master told us that the building
Shiba Seki Ramen was in

330
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,129
isn't owned by Abydos

331
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,590
Since when?

332
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,092
We don't know exactly

333
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,637
According to the master,
it's been that way for a few years

334
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,556
Then who owns it now?

335
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,183
Kaiser Corporation

336
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,939
This isn't a recent development

337
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,233
From Problem Solver 68
to the Helmet Gang,

338
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,776
since the beginning, really,

339
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,155
we've been trapped under
Kaiser Corporation's thumb

340
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,490
Ugh, this is so frustrating!

341
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:38,327
W-We haven't confirmed anything,

342
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,203
so we don't know for certain yet⋯

343
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,792
Lately,

344
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,628
no matter how much I sleep,
it never feels like enough

345
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,549
I really am an old-timer now

346
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:57,262
Hey! Look, look, Doesn't
that cloud look like a whale?

347
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,348
Uh, Hoshino?

348
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,225
C'mon! Look at that big ol' cloud!

349
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,187
Ayane, you can't see well
from where you're sitting!

350
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,190
Come over here
I won't bite

351
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,275
- Come on!
- Don't pull me!

352
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,402
Wait, this is a serious matter!

353
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,447
- Now's not the time for⋯
- Come on

354
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,282
Serika, you take a look too

355
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:20,243
Why are you joining in, Nonomi?

356
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,995
That cloud, right?

357
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,498
Doesn't it look more like
a dolphin than a whale?

358
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,500
Hm? Maybe?

359
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,585
Hoshino, are you referring

360
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,712
to the one above that?

361
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,005
Oh, I see

362
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:35,050
The one right under does
look like a dolphin

363
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,426
Then,

364
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,054
what about the one under
that? Is that a jellyfish?

365
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,139
What kind of jellyfish
have you seen before?

366
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,726
I guess there might be
some that look like that!

367
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,645
Since we're talking about it,

368
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,439
should we all go to the aquarium?

369
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,774
B-But⋯

370
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,568
Nothing's certain right now

371
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:58,657
Sitting around moping
won't change that!

372
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:00,826
And so,

373
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:05,288
at the very least, I'd like to
keep smiling while I can

374
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,878
Besides, Serika,

375
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:15,340
the aquarium has lots of jellyfish

376
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,176
They're so beautiful,
gracefully floating around!

377
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,846
Let's go together, just this once!

378
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,390
Fine, I'll go!

379
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,393
That's right, Taking breaks is important too!

380
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:29,062
Of course! We need to keep our spirits up!

381
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,814
Sensei, you'll come too, right?

382
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,192
What? You're gonna
just abandon us?!

383
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,070
We're students, so Sensei
has to chaperone us

384
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,363
That's true

385
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,365
All right! Let's all go

386
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,659
We're counting on you!

387
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,246
This will be fun!

388
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:08,477
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

389
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:14,232
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

390
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,863
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

391
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,866
With all those laughs we shared⋯

392
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:29,206
Even if⋯those moments were just ordinary

393
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,041
Those days⋯

394
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,586
One more time, one time more,

395
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:38,048
Knowing they won't come around again!

396
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,593
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

397
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:45,263
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

398
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,850
Would that let me finally forgive

399
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:52,354
All those regrets we made so willfully?

400
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,690
We only recognize the important things

401
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:59,861
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

402
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:03,406
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

403
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,786
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

404
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,958
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days⋯
