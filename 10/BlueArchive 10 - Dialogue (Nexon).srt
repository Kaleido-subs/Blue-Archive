1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,048
Sorry I'm⋯

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:06,840
Huh?

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,218
Am I the first to arrive?

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:15,349
(To the Abydos
Foreclosure Task Force)

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,100
(To the Abydos Foreclosure
Task Force) What is this?

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,267
(To the Abydos
Foreclosure Task Force)

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:20,938
It can't be!

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,440
- Hi, Ayane!
- Why?

9
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,233
(Withdrawal Application I am withdrawing
from the student bo dy for personal reasons,)

10
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,442
(Withdrawal Application I am withdrawing from the
student bo dy for personal reasons,) What's going on?!

11
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:25,817
(Withdrawal Application I am withdrawing
from the student bo dy for personal reasons,)

12
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,986
(Third Year
Takanashi Hoshino)

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:32,366
The sky blue archive!

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,170
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

15
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:49,424
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,720
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,558
Those clouds like whales are always changing

18
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,603
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

19
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:06,984
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

20
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,196
If I were here alone, here without all of you

21
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:15,284
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

22
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,286
A fateful coterie

23
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:25,252
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

24
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:34,219
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

25
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:39,975
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

26
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:51,069
Because this is the only place where we belong

27
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,036
(Abydos Foreclosure Task Force)

28
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,913
(Abydos Foreclosure Task Force) “To
the Abydos Foreclosure Task Force,"

29
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,082
"First of all,”

30
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,337
forgive me for doing this
with a letter

31
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:12,549
It felt more old-fashioned,
which suits me perfectly

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,137
The truth is, a recruiter has been
after me for a while now

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,224
Become a Kaiser PMC mercenary for life

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,355
in exchange for Abydos' debt
being paid off

35
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,315
That's the long and short of it

36
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,362
They must value the skills of
a wily old veteran like me

37
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,074
I know I talked a big game
at the Black Market

38
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,825
(Contract Agreement) I know I
talked a big game at the Black Market

39
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,493
(Contract Agreement)

40
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,829
I'm sorry I couldn't
keep my word

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,918
But things should be easier
for the Foreclosure Task Force now⋯

42
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,339
Let me take responsibility⋯

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,342
⋯as the final member

44
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,302
of the Abydos Student Council

45
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,930
So this is goodbye

46
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,144
"Sensei,"

47
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,188
- "To be honest⋯"
- To be honest,

48
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,940
I've never liked adults

49
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,111
When Shiroko carried
you in on her back,

50
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,906
I couldn't help but think
you were damn useless

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,035
But in the end,
you won those kids over

52
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,579
and earned their trust

53
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,667
So I'm leaving things
in your care now

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,837
Everyone believes in you⋯

55
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,214
and that has to be enough

56
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,009
And ever since I met
an adult like you,

57
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,219
I really⋯

58
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,348
Well, some things are
better left unsaid

59
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,685
Shiroko, Nonomi

60
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,271
Serika, Ayane

61
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,939
I'm counting on you

62
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,984
Please look after our school

63
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,945
It may be half-buried in sand,

64
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,864
but it's the only place

65
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,408
(964,217,852 yen until we're fully
repaid! We've got this!) that matters to me

66
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,950
(964,217,852 yen until we're fully repaid!
We've got this!)

67
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,662
Also, if we ever end up

68
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,623
facing each other as enemies,

69
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,208
then⋯

70
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,420
Don't hesitate to destroy my halo

71
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,255
Please

72
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,133
What is this?!

73
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,219
How can she just give up?

74
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,264
I won't accept this!

75
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,225
Shiroko!

76
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,520
I'll go! We need to
rescue her!

77
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,981
Shiroko, hold on!

78
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,942
She's right
Let's assess the situation

79
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,236
But Hoshino⋯

80
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,037
Keep firing!
Pacify this district!

81
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,001
The Abydos Student Council
has disbanded!

82
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,797
Which means that Abydos High School

83
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,466
belongs to the Kaiser Corporation!

84
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,386
An army of Kaiser PMC soldiers is invading!

85
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,722
They're attacking the
district indiscriminately!

86
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,225
Why now, of all times?

87
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,976
We have to stop them

88
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,728
But without Hoshino⋯

89
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,271
Hold on a minute, everyone

90
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,982
Evacuating the citizens
has to be our first priority

91
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,242
How cruel

92
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,287
- Are you hurt?
- J-Just a little

93
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,581
Why are they attacking us?

94
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,792
We're still investigating
the situation ourselves

95
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,296
Abydos Foreclosure Task Force
spotted! This way!

96
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,590
- Shiroko!
- Yeah!

97
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,927
Everyone, evacuate this area!

98
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,262
O-Okay!

99
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,520
Shiroko!

100
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,606
This is it!

101
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,567
What are you doing?

102
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,283
- You take that side!
- Okay

103
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,160
- Damn it!
- They're tough!

104
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,956
- Nonomi!
- Got it!

105
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,218
Are you all right?

106
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,596
Yeah, I'm fine

107
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,847
But⋯

108
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,642
They just keep coming

109
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,524
It's all down to us

110
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,406
My, have you really
come out to greet me?

111
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,867
You saved me the trouble
of visiting

112
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,077
Abydos High School myself

113
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,289
Why is your corporation
attacking the city?

114
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,083
You have no right

115
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,877
regardless of how much
land you own!

116
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,505
And the school building is
still Abydos property!

117
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,133
You're breaking the law!

118
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,344
The General Student Council
won't overlook this!

119
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,723
Where is Hoshino?
Give her back to us!

120
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,060
I have no idea what
you're talking about

121
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,812
But the General Student Council?
Don't make me laugh

122
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,149
Call them all you want

123
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,943
How many times

124
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,904
have you requested
their assistance?

125
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,533
Did they even once help
with your debt?

126
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,079
Now you understand

127
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,792
it doesn't matter how much you struggle
Nothing will change

128
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,045
And the final member of
the Abydos Student Council,

129
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,714
Takanashi Hoshino,
has dropped out

130
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,468
Which means your student council
no longer exists

131
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,555
You are nothing now

132
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,557
What are you talking about?!

133
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,019
Even if the student council disbands,
Abydos has the Foreclosure Task Force!

134
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,397
We're right here!

135
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,359
The Foreclosure Task Force⋯
isn't an authorized club

136
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,111
- What?
- Ayane?

137
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,196
The Student Council was long gone

138
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,199
by the time the task force
was created

139
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,121
She's right
You're an unauthorized club

140
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,999
without official documentation

141
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:23,878
You may as well be ghosts

142
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,755
But look on the bright side

143
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,632
With Abydos High School dead,

144
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,846
you're finally free from
all that tedious debt

145
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,888
No way⋯

146
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,350
But that would mean all the
hard work we've done⋯

147
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,687
You actually intended to work

148
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,065
for hundreds of years to
pay off that debt?

149
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,692
You can't possibly be so deluded

150
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,529
I thought you only
kept up appearances

151
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,657
because you were embarrassed
to admit the truth

152
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,870
Did you really exhaust yourselves
to repay that debt?

153
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,371
Why bother?

154
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,457
Shut your mouth!

155
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,208
I'll shoot

156
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,757
If we fight⋯what difference
will it make?

157
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,008
Ayane?

158
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,093
Even if we win somehow⋯

159
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,262
What are we supposed
to do next?

160
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,766
And even if we get
the school back,

161
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,519
it won't erase our debt⋯

162
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,357
The land that's been sold
isn't coming back

163
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,319
Without Hoshino

164
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,987
or the Student Council⋯

165
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,614
What can an

166
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,825
unofficial club like ours

167
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,661
hope to do?

168
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,124
Ayane⋯

169
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,375
Why⋯

170
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,337
Why are we always alone?

171
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,963
Hoshino⋯

172
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,633
What are we supposed to do?

173
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,139
Massive explosion detected to the north!

174
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,683
Our reinforcements from Bravo Squad
were caught in the blast!

175
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,518
What?!

176
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,353
Mike Squad was hit in the east!

177
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,606
Massive C4 explosion detected!

178
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,859
What's happening?!

179
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,822
Come on, I can't believe my ears!

180
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,282
What are you idiots doing?

181
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,786
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth

182
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,080
Forsake mercy

183
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,749
and walk the path of chaos

184
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,963
Wasn't that the motto
of the Masked Swimsuit Gang?

185
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,177
You guys are⋯

186
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,224
How am I supposed to admire you
after that pathetic display?

187
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,061
Sheesh, Aru,
lighten up a little

188
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,313
Little Miss Four-Eyes
Is the anxious type

189
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,190
She can't help it

190
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,651
What are you doing here?

191
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:56,281
Making adorable Miss Four-Eyes cry
Is a pretty serious crime

192
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,658
Which is why⋯

193
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,327
⋯I'm gonna rip you guys apart!

194
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,955
It's Problem Solver 68!

195
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,043
When there's no
finish line in sight,

196
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,713
and everything you do
ends in failure⋯

197
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,798
And you know that tomorrow

198
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,551
will only bring you more
hardship and hard times⋯

199
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,138
Finally

200
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,849
Well who cares?!

201
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,944
Are you really going to
let such useless feelings

202
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,864
stop you from rescuing
your friend?!

203
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,868
If you're okay with
losing everything,

204
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,288
you're all even stupider
than you look!

205
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,834
Damn you Problem Solver dogs!

206
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,504
You dare bite at the hand
that feeds you?!

207
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,006
Shut up!

208
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:59,218
Working with these kids is way better
than taking your orders!

209
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,306
Villains are supposed to stab their
employers in the back, you know?

210
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,016
You all⋯

211
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,561
Yeah, you're right
That's what villains do

212
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,897
That was just what we needed

213
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,399
We can't stand around here

214
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,444
Who cares if we're
unauthorized or whatever?

215
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,155
Whether we're above board
or not doesn't matter

216
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,616
We need to save Hoshino

217
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,952
Who cares about anything else?

218
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:28,248
You! It's useless to resist!

219
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,000
How dare you attack my students!

220
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,420
We're taking Hoshino back

221
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,922
Don't be ridiculous!

222
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,174
You're just some teacher!

223
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,468
You don't have the right to⋯

224
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,768
This calls for emergency measures

225
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,271
But sir, the prototype's untested!

226
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,399
- Using it is too risky—
- I don't care!

227
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:58,403
I'll force them to accept their bitter end

228
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,828
Behold!

229
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,247
My cutting-edge exosuit,

230
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,291
the pinnacle of our battle tech!

231
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:16,087
Its high-purity armor and
powerful actuators

232
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,964
make it the ultimate weapon!

233
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,426
Wow, it's gigantic!

234
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,845
What should we do?

235
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,014
That looks tough

236
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,141
Yeah, it's not going down easy

237
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,767
Or at least⋯

238
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,521
It wouldn't if there were
only four of us

239
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,233
Try to keep up

240
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,569
You can do that, right?

241
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,487
Yeah

242
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,241
All right, let's go!

243
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,956
Not a scratch

244
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,292
You can't stop me!

245
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,504
What an insane
amount of power⋯

246
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,802
A direct hit
would be devastating

247
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,763
We need another way⋯

248
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,473
Explosives

249
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,350
How many do you have left?

250
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,978
Enough to give us a chance, maybe

251
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,731
Then we've got this, Trust me

252
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,611
I'll try anything, no matter
how long the odds!

253
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,364
That's what it means
to be an outlaw!

254
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,200
Children, What a pathetic attack!

255
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,745
Go!

256
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,583
- Let's move
- Okay!

257
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,383
Sneaking away? It's too late!

258
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,302
You're in the way,
SO move aside!

259
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,892
- Thanks
- N-No problem

260
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,768
Hey:-

261
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,312
Just keep looking forward,
all right?

262
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,480
Y-Yeah!

263
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,024
Damn it, Stop them!

264
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,403
What should we do?
A fight here would destroy the store

265
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,281
Ta-da!

266
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,909
A grenade?

267
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,537
Yeah, but don't worry!

268
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,170
Amazing! How fun!

269
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,255
Isn't it?

270
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,716
- Leave them to me
- Thanks!

271
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,427
Do your best!

272
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,475
You brats really
don't give up, do you?

273
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,607
Only a little longer⋯

274
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,819
I don't care what you're up to

275
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,321
It's time to end this

276
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,621
There you are!

277
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,790
- Serika!
- Yeah!

278
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,085
Damn it, they're running!

279
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,387
This seems dangerous

280
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,431
Well⋯

281
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,018
I can't sit by and
let others protect me

282
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,525
- Go for it!
- Yeah

283
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,653
- Be careful
- I'll cover you!

284
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,996
I'm your opponent

285
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,874
You!

286
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,044
Looks like it's started

287
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,213
In that case,

288
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,090
let's handle these guys, Haruka

289
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,635
Yes, let's sweep them away

290
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,724
Looks like Mutsuki and
Haruka are doing fine

291
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,772
Not going to happen

292
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,442
You're all so eager to
interfere with our work

293
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,111
You think you buzzkills

294
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,197
can stop us?

295
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,328
Stop dodging, you rats!

296
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,498
Get back in your hole!

297
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,799
Ugh, what a nuisance!

298
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,488
This is your ultimate weapon?

299
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,074
Don't make me laugh!

300
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,952
You think you've won?

301
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,579
That puny body can't stop

302
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:06,210
this 12,860-horsepower machine!

303
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,673
Th-This—

304
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,304
Mission accomplished!

305
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,680
Got him

306
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:21,851
Shiroko!

307
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,986
Still willing to fight
after that attack?

308
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,904
You're brave⋯for a rat

309
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,824
Choke on your compliments

310
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,494
You would live longer
if you were smart,

311
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,748
like Hoshino

312
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,751
Just give up already!

313
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,085
No way⋯

314
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,005
Shiroko, five meters back!

315
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,549
You dare look away?!

316
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,183
This ends now!

317
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,982
Sensei!

318
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,569
Shiroko!

319
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,661
Hoshino

320
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,456
Protecting the front line is tough

321
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,255
Wh-What?!

322
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,384
How could this be?!

323
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,936
- Shiroko!
- Are you okay?

324
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,771
Yeah, no big deal

325
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,941
I'm glad we're all safe

326
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,692
Thanks Ayane,

327
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,361
Nonomi, Serika

328
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,906
We pulled off our plan

329
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,575
Wasn't that a bit much?

330
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,371
Well, they're no outlaws,
but I figured they could handle it

331
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,249
Director, can you stand?!

332
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,419
The medical team is—

333
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,671
You should just give it up

334
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,465
I still--

335
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,884
What, you want to keep going?

336
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,388
We can beat you up some more,
if you insist!

337
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,391
Retreat for now

338
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,309
Regroup our soldiers!

339
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,395
- Yes, sir!
- Everyone, pull back!

340
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,480
The director has ordered a retreat!

341
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,400
I repeat, the director
orders you to retreat!

342
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,318
This isn't over⋯

343
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,363
We'll repay this defeat tenfold

344
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,033
They're withdrawing⋯

345
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,079
We did it

346
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,874
That's the first time
I've heard someone

347
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,042
actually say "This isn't over,”

348
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,462
Good job, everyone

349
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,964
That was a tough battle,

350
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,008
but you all fought well

351
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,050
Yeah

352
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,677
Thanks, Problem Solver 68,

353
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,764
for such timely assistance

354
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,641
Ah, it's nothing, really

355
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,603
No matter what anyone says,
we're hard boiled outlaws

356
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,814
Aru was super nervous
from the start, though

357
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,733
Don't tell them that!

358
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,986
Then, our next step⋯

359
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,529
- Yup!
- Yeah!

360
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:23,991
Wait for us,

361
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,826
Hoshino

362
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,042
Why⋯?

363
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,127
Why are you attacking Abydos?!

364
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,379
What's the matter, Hoshino?

365
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,508
I kept my word

366
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:44,970
Your former school's debt has been settled,

367
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,350
exactly as promised

368
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,895
However⋯

369
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,647
Now that you've dropped out,

370
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,900
Abydos no longer has
an official Student Council

371
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,986
Unfortunately, that means
the school must close

372
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,698
Of course, Abydos
has always been

373
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,826
a secondary concern

374
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,286
Hoshino

375
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,832
You have been our prime objective
from the start

376
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,003
Having you sign that contract,

377
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,632
coercing you into signing away
your rights⋯

378
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,678
We only worked with the Kaiser Corporation⋯

379
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,056
because our interests aligned

380
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,893
My apologies if you misunderstood

381
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,229
But I was never part

382
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,524
of such a trifling company

383
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,195
I didn't claim the most promising
Mystic in Kivotos

384
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,200
just to waste her as a
mercenary soldier

385
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,582
You'll be helping us with
something more important

386
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,960
An experiment we've
truly longed to run

387
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,963
Welcome to your new life

388
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,508
Now I get it

389
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,470
I was being manipulated
by adults yet again

390
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,390
I'm sorry, everyone

391
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,184
This is my fault

392
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,063
Shiroko, Nonomi

393
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,691
Serika, Ayane

394
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,817
Sensei⋯

395
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,320
⋯Yume

396
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,988
I'm sorry
