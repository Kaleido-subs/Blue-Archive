1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,753
- What'd you say?
- Hm?

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,504
Ayane⋯

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,840
Read it again?

4
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,051
Calm down first, Serika⋯

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,510
I'm perfectly calm!

6
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,554
She's right, Serika

7
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,181
We can't lose our heads

8
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,183
You're shaking, Sensei

9
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,728
Ayane, is it true?

10
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,520
Yes

11
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,941
Based on these documents⋯

12
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,817
Kaiser Loans is

13
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,654
funding the Helmet Gang

14
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,364
What?

15
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,782
No way

16
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,284
If that's true,

17
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,787
not only did the Helmet Gang

18
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,457
try to ambush us⋯

19
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,420
⋯but our money paid
for THEIR guns!

20
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,384
The sky blue archive!

21
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:03,188
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

22
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:07,442
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

23
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:11,738
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

24
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,575
Those clouds like whales are always changing

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,621
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

26
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:25,002
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,256
If I were here alone, here without all of you

28
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,302
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

29
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,304
A fateful coterie

30
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:43,270
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

31
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:52,237
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

32
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:57,993
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

33
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:09,087
Because this is the only place where we belong

34
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,016
(Cash/Interest)
According to this,

35
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,269
(Cash/Interest from Abydos Mission Fund for Kata-Kata
Helmet Gang) they've received about 7.88 million yen

36
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,229
That's⋯

37
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,482
Yes, Exactly

38
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,942
Um, what is so important

39
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,695
about this 7.88 million yen?

40
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,364
Wait, don't tell me—!

41
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:39,076
Yes, It's our last
loan payment

42
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,495
7.88 million⋯

43
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,622
You really owe that much?

44
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,249
That's just a fraction
We really owe 900 million

45
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,920
Hey, why don't we
talk about that later

46
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,799
This document is a
balance sheet from Kaiser Loans

47
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,343
You can see the
7.88 million yen

48
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,388
that we paid back

49
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,057
This paper must've come from

50
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,102
the cash delivery van
that came to our school

51
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,687
What about this?

52
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,688
Right after they took our 7.88 million,

53
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,314
(Deposit)
Right after they took our 7.88 million,

54
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:09,481
Right after they took our 7.88 million,

55
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,774
(Collection)
Right after they took our 7.88 million,

56
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,360
(Mission Fund for Kata-Kata Helmet Gang)
They set aside 5 million as mission funds

57
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,570
(Withdrawal)
for the Kata-Kata Helmet Gang

58
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,072
Mission funds?

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,283
They handed over 5 million
to the Helmet Gang

60
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,536
to pay for their
campaign?

61
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,496
What campaign?

62
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,208
I assume it's the one
to get rid of us

63
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,543
But that means⋯

64
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,298
Our true enemy is Kaiser Loans

65
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,803
Why would they do this?

66
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,888
If the school goes bankrupt,

67
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,308
they still won't get their money

68
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,063
K-Kaiser Loans?

69
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,775
That's the loan shark company
run by the notorious

70
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,194
Kaiser Corporation, right?

71
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,992
I doubt Kaiser Loans
is acting alone

72
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,869
Shiroko?

73
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,831
The Kaiser Corporation
must be behind this too

74
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,000
It's possible

75
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,338
Thanks for your
help today, everyone

76
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,174
No, we should
thank you

77
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,676
Sorry for the trouble

78
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:27,225
I'll let the Tea Party know!

79
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,602
Hifumi?

80
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,228
The Kaiser Corporation

81
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,732
Is working with criminals
and other shadowy forces

82
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,901
Your situation is proof

83
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:40,822
Now that I know,
I can't just avert my eyes

84
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:41,782
Hifumi⋯

85
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,492
Thank you so much!

86
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,536
If Trinity's student
council can help us,

87
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,997
maybe we can fix this

88
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,957
Right, Hoshino?

89
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,335
Uh⋯

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,838
One thing that did
surprise me is

91
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,883
the fact your debt
is around 1 billion

92
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,468
It's not a billion!

93
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,386
It's 960 million!

94
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,389
Serika, you're
missing the point⋯

95
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:10,143
Anyway, once the Tea Party
hears about this, surely they'll⋯

96
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,687
The Tea Party
already knows

97
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,480
Pardon?

98
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,107
And not just the
Tea Party

99
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,569
Gehenna and Millennium
probably know too

100
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,656
Wait, then why haven't they⋯?

101
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,742
They're playing
blind on purpose

102
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,619
On purpose?

103
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,497
Hifumi, you're
really sweet

104
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,958
But the world isn't

105
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,668
If the other schools intervene,

106
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,088
it'll just create
more trouble

107
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,506
What do you mean?

108
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,176
Right now, Abydos High
is on the verge of a shutdown

109
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,096
If larger schools like Trinity or Gehenna

110
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,432
stepped in, we
couldn't really object

111
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,227
Do you follow?

112
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,687
You're saying

113
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,815
that if they did something bad
while pretending to help,

114
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,316
you couldn't stop them⋯

115
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,360
Is that it?

116
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,403
Hm

117
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:06,116
Hoshino, isn't that
a little cynical?

118
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,536
Right! Why wouldn't
they help us?

119
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,538
I agree

120
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,499
Don't ignore the "what-ifs,"

121
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,585
"What-ifs?"

122
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,045
I don't get it!

123
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,506
Don't fret

124
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,134
We'll find a solution!

125
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,929
Right?! Maybe⋯?

126
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,556
Hopefully⋯

127
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,143
Sensei, you're supposed
to inspire confidence!

128
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,354
Let's calm down and think⋯

129
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,315
This is no time to be calm

130
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,443
Hey, don't stare
at me like that

131
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,153
"What-ifs⋯"

132
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,696
Right

133
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,532
We ignored the
"what-ifs" back then⋯

134
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,992
Now Abydos⋯

135
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,083
Wait a minute!

136
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,045
What are you youngins
talking about?

137
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,006
Hifumi was just
about to say something

138
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,675
What's the matter,
"Faust?"

139
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,136
Please don't
call me that

140
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,554
Okay⋯

141
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,557
Hifumi, mastermind of
the Masked Swimsuit Gang!

142
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,059
Please! Stop saying that!

143
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,519
Knock it off
You're embarrassing her

144
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,273
I need to get going

145
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,942
I had a nice
time today

146
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,111
Shiroko, you're the
only one who had fun

147
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,698
Let's have some fun
at your school next time

148
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,117
Do your best, Hifumi!

149
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,329
You too! I know
things are hard,

150
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,956
but don't give up!

151
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,165
Right

152
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,921
See you later

153
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,552
Are we gonna be okay?

154
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,973
We can worry
about it later

155
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,100
This old-timer's exhausted

156
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,353
Let's meet tomorrow then

157
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,148
Go home and get some
rest, everyone

158
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,275
- Great
- Agreed

159
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,487
Staying up all night's
bad for your complexion

160
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,037
Morning

161
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,712
Aru, were you up late?

162
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,171
I slept great

163
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,220
We planned the next
attack on Abydos

164
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,055
Right, Kayoko?

165
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,851
We'll plant dozens
of bombs in advance

166
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,479
Then detonate them
when our enemies pass by

167
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,773
Haruka will also⋯

168
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,903
Paying attention?

169
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,364
Course I am!

170
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,075
- But you just⋯
- I was thinking

171
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,536
Look, please just confirm

172
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,330
- Is this plan good?
- Yeah

173
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,667
Aru, if you're worried
about money so much,

174
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,296
let's just use the cash
from that bag we found

175
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,923
No way

176
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,968
That's money they
dropped by accident

177
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,345
Only losers would use that

178
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,055
It'd tank our reputation

179
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,642
Could we ask our client
for a deposit then?

180
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,478
No deposits

181
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,188
That's against our code

182
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,689
Didn't I already tell you?

183
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:29,861
"If we take the client's money,
we must follow the client's orders,"

184
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,280
- That so?
- Exactly

185
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,117
Right, I remember
you said that before

186
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,788
We only take their money
once the job's done

187
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,706
Otherwise we'd never

188
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,001
be able to achieve
our vision

189
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,712
We have a vision?

190
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,755
Of course!

191
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,509
"Hardboiled outlaws,
untethered by rules or laws,"

192
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,929
That's what Problem Solver 68 is

193
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,849
Boss, can we
just give up

194
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,392
and go home
to Gehenna?

195
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,772
You think the
Prefect Team will let us?

196
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,191
Right

197
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,735
The Prefect Team is a pain

198
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,864
They're one of the
strongest groups in all of Kivotos

199
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,868
That's just because of the
Head Prefect, Hina

200
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,830
It's not a stretch to say

201
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,541
the bulk of that
team's strength is hers

202
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,668
In other words,

203
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,588
we can beat all the
other prefects except her

204
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,340
That's a take

205
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,467
IF we have a
foolproof plan

206
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,096
We're not going
back to Gehenna

207
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,852
We have to be hard boiled outlaws
untethered by rules and laws

208
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:48,022
Isn't that the vision
of Problem Solver 68?

209
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,777
Exactly

210
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,532
- Welcome back, Haruka
- Nice job

211
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,034
I'm back

212
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,787
Aru

213
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,165
If you ever need me,
let me know

214
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:09,085
I'll crush anyone
with these two hands

215
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,962
These hands

216
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,262
Oh my, Aru
So you were just hungry?

217
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,973
- You're annoying
- Let's go eat

218
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,558
All right

219
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,977
Where to?
Shiba Seki Ramen?

220
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,438
- Don't worry

221
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,899
The Abydos part-timer
only works afternoons

222
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,443
Guess we have
no other choice

223
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,445
Let's go, Haruka

224
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,863
Okay

225
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,496
Good morning

226
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,124
You're in early today

227
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,001
Morning, Sensei

228
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,087
Hoshino, Nonomi⋯

229
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,547
What are you two
doing here?

230
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,551
Forget it, This is my spot

231
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,720
That's not what I meant

232
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,056
Right, Hoshino

233
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,975
Didn't anyone teach
you to share?

234
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,436
That's not what I
meant either!

235
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,813
Oh my!

236
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,024
Hoshino, where are
you going?

237
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,485
Today's my day off

238
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,278
I'll be relaxing

239
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,864
Let me know
if anything comes up

240
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,077
Another nap?

241
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,703
Looks like

242
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,206
It's a nice day for it

243
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,460
Hoshino's changed

244
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,419
Huh?

245
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,131
She's usually zoned out
these days

246
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,134
But when we first met

247
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,804
she moved like something
was chasing her

248
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,931
What was chasing her?

249
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,767
Honestly?

250
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,310
Everything

251
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,646
From what I've heard

252
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,733
when Hoshino first arrived,
there was this senior

253
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,944
She was the last head
of the Abydos Student Council

254
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,737
(Student Council Room) She was the
last head of the Abydos Student Council

255
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,407
She left

256
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,825
And Hoshino took
on her role

257
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,244
(No Entry) And
Hoshino took on her role

258
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:06,744
(No Entry)

259
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,747
She was only a first year

260
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,500
Maybe that's why

261
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:16,004
she never reached out
to the other schools

262
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,381
Now she's a lot
more laid-back

263
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,930
Still, I don't know
all the details

264
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,100
- You think I'm the reason?
- Huh?

265
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,311
For her change

266
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,896
No?

267
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,737
Sorry, what I meant was⋯?

268
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,124
I definitely believe it was you

269
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,213
(Shiba Seki Ramen)

270
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,926
Thank you for waiting

271
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,720
At last!

272
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,264
Thanks for the grub!

273
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,687
So good!

274
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,814
A bowl for each of us

275
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,275
Are you sure this is okay?

276
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:23,446
You came all this way
to eat my ramen

277
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,698
Why not?

278
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,409
Thank you

279
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,788
Thank you so much!

280
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,291
I'm truly grateful

281
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,918
Don't mention it

282
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,129
We'll cherish every bite

283
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,633
It's on the house
Just dig in

284
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,676
After all,

285
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,262
you lot are
Serika's friends

286
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,939
No one's here, even
with ramen this good

287
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,941
Probably the location

288
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,361
This area's been losing
residents from the desertification

289
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,570
No⋯

290
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,157
We are not friends!

291
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,869
- Don't shout
- I get it now

292
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,455
This shop is the problem

293
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,374
This shop!

294
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,375
What do you mean?

295
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,585
Don't you like the ramen here?

296
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,462
Of course I do!

297
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,257
It's savory
The portions are huge

298
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,008
Even the cook is great

299
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,885
Then what's the problem?

300
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,595
Everything!

301
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,973
We're here to work

302
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,142
Hardboiled outlaws
like us

303
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,019
shouldn't be swayed
by cheap kindness

304
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,527
-I don't get it
- I understand

305
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,736
Haruka

306
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,197
Haruka, you
understand me right?

307
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,073
Yes

308
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,661
We've got to destroy
this shop, right?

309
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,541
Haruka, what do you mean by
"destroy?"

310
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,418
Just that

311
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,630
Why do you—?

312
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,469
Fire in the hole

313
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,262
Wait, Haruka!

314
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,147
There was an explosion
within 10-kilometers of here

315
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,440
The location was⋯

316
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,775
Ayane?

317
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,611
The location was⋯

318
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,654
Shiba Seki Ramen

319
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,990
Why there?

320
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,868
What could they
possibly be after?

321
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,037
Maybe Serika?

322
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,997
Me? Why?

323
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,583
For now,
let's head over

324
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,293
What about Hoshino?

325
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,253
I'll tell her

326
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,048
We have to rescue the master

327
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,049
Right

328
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,220
Wait for us,

329
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,763
Master!

330
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,312
Ow⋯

331
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,986
What happened?

332
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,197
Found you, Aru

333
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,950
Mutsuki, Kayoko⋯

334
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,035
You okay, Boss?

335
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,328
Y-Yeah

336
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,914
Where's Haruka?

337
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,166
She should be nearby⋯

338
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,128
So she really planted a bomb
at Shiba Seki

339
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,632
Come to think of it,
what was our plan, exactly?

340
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,760
We went over it this morning⋯

341
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,429
But this wasn't
a part of it

342
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,931
What?

343
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,935
What do we do now?

344
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,273
What's the problem?
Isn't this what you wanted?

345
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,775
You said "Destroy this shop,"

346
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,861
No, I said that

347
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,989
Haruka, are you all right?

348
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,575
Yes, I'm fine

349
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,036
Hey Aru⋯

350
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,123
Did I mess up?

351
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,961
I'm so sorry

352
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,548
I was the one who
set off that bomb

353
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,342
As penance,
I offer up my life!

354
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,760
Stop that

355
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,013
We need to figure out
our next move

356
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:18,931
Boss?

357
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,813
Look at this situation

358
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,568
We're real villains
now, huh?

359
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:31,569
Huh?

360
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,363
So we met our goal?

361
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,365
What are you
talking about?

362
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,118
You wanted to be
a villainess, right?

363
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,202
Huh?

364
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,455
You blew up
the ramen shop

365
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,459
They fed us, and you
nuked them on a whim

366
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,921
You're so diabolical,
Aru

367
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,717
Of course I am!

368
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,470
Merciless and ruthless!

369
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,930
"We'll do the crime
if you've got the dime,"

370
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,058
That's our motto

371
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,185
Problem Solver 68!

372
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,231
Look over there

373
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,276
It's that part-timer
from the ramen shop

374
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,654
What are you
doing here?

375
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,783
What do you think?

376
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,995
Did you really blow
up Shiba Seki Ramen?

377
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,789
If we did?

378
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,166
We won't let you
get away with it

379
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,419
You hear that, Aru?

380
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,922
The timing's awful

381
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,426
But we have to deal
with them eventually

382
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:42,098
I won't fail you again, Aru

383
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,767
Wh-What do I do?

384
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,979
Should I just tell the
truth and say sorry?

385
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,150
What about
our reputation?

386
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,529
What about my pride
as an outlaw?

387
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,323
Hey, don't just stand
there glassy-eyed

388
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,242
Answer us

389
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,077
Zip it!

390
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,496
You're right

391
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,374
We were the ones who
blew up Shiba Seki Ramen

392
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,252
Us, Problem Solver 68!

393
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:16,632
Now you know just
how nasty we can be

394
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,300
Aru!

395
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,679
Serika

396
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,889
The master's safe

397
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,100
How is he?

398
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,435
Just some minor injuries

399
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,894
What a relief

400
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,896
We'll get him to safety,

401
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,815
then head your way

402
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,191
Got it

403
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,069
- Serika, good news!
- Unforgivable

404
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,529
Serika⋯

405
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,739
Shiroko

406
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,618
I'm sorry, but I
can't just stand by

407
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,038
Me neither

408
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,003
All right, bring it

409
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,922
Let's go!

410
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,604
What now?

411
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,273
- It's them
- Them?

412
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,984
Why now of all times?

413
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,195
Aru, wake up

414
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,072
Aru, Aru!

415
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,075
Is everyone okay?

416
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,952
I'm fine

417
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,579
Where'd that
artillery come from?

418
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,830
That was⋯

419
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,293
The attack came from over there

420
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,590
Shelling successful
Targets are on the back foot

421
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,718
What's our next move, Iori?

422
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,555
It seems we have some
unexpected guests

423
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,641
Who are they?

424
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,726
What was the name⋯

425
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,936
Abydos?

426
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,689
Right, The Abydos High
School Foreclosure Task Force

427
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,777
(Prefect Team) What to
do? That's obvious, Chinatsu

428
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,531
Anyone who gets in
the way of our duties

429
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,161
IS an enemy

430
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:31,392
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

431
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:37,189
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

432
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,778
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

433
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,781
With all those laughs we shared⋯

434
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:52,121
Even if⋯those moments were just ordinary

435
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,956
Those days⋯

436
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,459
One more time, one time more,

437
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,963
Knowing they won't come around again!

438
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,508
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

439
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,137
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

440
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,765
Would that let me finally forgive

441
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,269
All those regrets we made so willfully?

442
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,647
We only recognize the important things

443
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,776
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

444
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,322
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

445
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,701
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

446
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,873
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days⋯
