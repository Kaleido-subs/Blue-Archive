1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,837
Hoshino's cell phone?

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,924
Yes, I'd like you to
use it to track her down

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,592
Understood

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,677
Please wait

5
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,436
How did it go?

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,022
No luck

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,652
I accessed the General Student
Council's central network

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,196
But I couldn't determine her current location

9
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,614
Really?

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,033
But we need a lead

11
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,327
In that case⋯

12
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:38,914
Come in

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,002
Who is it?

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,713
Could it be Hoshino?

15
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:51,843
(Sensei's Office)

16
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,477
What's this?

17
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,326
The sky blue archive!

18
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:29,131
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

19
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:33,343
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,681
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

21
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,518
Those clouds like whales are always changing

22
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:45,564
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

23
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:50,944
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

24
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:55,157
If I were here alone, here without all of you

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,244
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

26
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,288
A fateful coterie

27
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:09,212
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

28
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:18,180
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

29
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:23,935
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

30
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:34,988
Because this is the only place where we belong

31
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,253
Is this the place?

32
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,632
This is definitely the right floor⋯

33
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,512
I've been expecting you, Sensei

34
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,641
I wanted to speak face-to-face

35
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,018
at least once

36
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,355
The General Student Council
president's inscrutable advocate⋯

37
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,692
Sensei, from Schale's
Federal Investigation Club

38
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,905
Don't worry

39
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,784
We don't intend to fight you

40
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,661
We want to work with you

41
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,788
You see, a small school

42
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,917
like Abydos is no problem for us

43
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,254
But you, Sensei, you're different

44
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,008
We're very wary of you

45
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,302
Who are you?

46
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,639
Ah, yes, I haven't introduced myself

47
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,726
For now, you can call me

48
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,187
Black Suit

49
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,064
I prefer that name

50
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,028
We're very similar, you and I.

51
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,154
Similar?

52
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,780
Yes, we're similar in that

53
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,241
neither of us is from Kivotos

54
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,579
In fact, my people are from
a different realm altogether

55
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,332
Gematria

56
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,792
You may call us that

57
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,296
To put it in terms you'll understand,

58
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,217
you could say it's my organization

59
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,345
Gematria prefers to

60
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,515
observe, explore, and study

61
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,183
In that way, we remain

62
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,312
just as inscrutable as you

63
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,650
Now before we discuss
any more, I must ask⋯

64
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,528
Are you willing to work with us?

65
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,570
I refuse.

66
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,826
What do you seek in
Kivotos that makes you

67
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,497
so quick to reject
our knowledge?

68
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm here to get Hoshino back

69
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,004
You have no right

70
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,340
to make such a demand.

71
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,174
(Name, Advisor)

72
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,261
(Name, Advisor)
She is no longer an Abydos student

73
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:44,511
(Name, Advisor)

74
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,595
(Name, Advisor)
You're wrong

75
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,432
Didn't you receive her withdrawal letter?

76
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,061
I saw it, yes

77
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,188
Then you already know

78
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,276
There's nothing you can do, Sensei

79
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,319
That's not true

80
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,238
You see⋯

81
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,031
I haven't signed it yet

82
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,575
(Name, Advisor)
I haven't signed it yet

83
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,158
(Name, Advisor)

84
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,871
Which means Hoshino's still part
of the Foreclosure Task Force

85
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,248
She's still the vice president
of Abydos High School

86
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,209
And she's still my student

87
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,422
I see, As their teacher, you must sign

88
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,134
all withdrawals to finalize them

89
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,512
How irritating

90
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,097
You⋯

91
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,808
You tricked Hoshino and the others

92
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,270
You crushed their spirits
and made them suffer

93
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,189
Yes, that's exactly right

94
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,818
If you must define us by our actions,

95
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,528
then we are undoubtedly evil

96
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,780
Nonetheless, we have
played by the rules

97
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,408
I hope that's clear

98
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,578
We are not to blame for

99
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,872
the disaster that struck Abydos

100
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,083
A sandstorm of that magnitude,

101
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,085
though rare, is not unheard of

102
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,380
It's completely natural

103
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,052
It only follows that, as people die of thirst,

104
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,722
someone should appear to sell them water

105
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,558
It's all part of the process

106
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,979
And is it natural for that water
to cost them everything they have?

107
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,483
Yes, It's common practice

108
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,069
That's the way of this world

109
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,781
The haves exploit the have-nots

110
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,576
The weak do not decide their fate

111
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,411
Sensei

112
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,914
If you relinquish Hoshino,

113
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,209
we'll protect Abydos for you

114
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,670
and restore its former glory,

115
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,173
so its students can be carefree

116
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,385
It's what Hoshino would want

117
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,261
Even if you could do that,

118
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,722
my students would never agree to it

119
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:58,269
Why are you determined to oppose us?

120
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,397
You're powerless

121
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,691
You have no means to fight us

122
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,025
That may be so

123
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,362
But if someone needs help, I'll fight,

124
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,406
no matter how great the opponent

125
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,201
If they keep calling out,
eventually someone will answer

126
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,412
I'm determined to prove that

127
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,289
That's absurd

128
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,627
You're here, and those
kids still ended up alone

129
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,254
At least

130
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,214
I heard them

131
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,258
I heard their voices

132
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,344
Can't you just ignore them?

133
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,723
This isn't really your problem

134
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,141
I refuse

135
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,144
Why?

136
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,105
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

137
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,483
Why? Why? Why? Why?

138
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,987
I don't understand
Why do you refuse?

139
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,573
Those kids suffered so much

140
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,950
And no adult took responsibility

141
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,078
So you're going to do it for them?

142
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,956
You're not even their family

143
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,918
You're right, I'm not
family—or anything like it

144
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,796
Pure chance brought me to Abydos

145
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,840
And chance brought me to those kids

146
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,050
It's as simple as that

147
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,387
But so what?

148
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:15,930
You want a reason?

149
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,308
It's because they asked for my help

150
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,726
And that's enough

151
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,855
That makes you a responsible adult?

152
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,106
Yes

153
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,859
When kids laugh, you laugh with them

154
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,069
When they're sad, you stay by their side

155
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,197
When they're in trouble, you help

156
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,199
That's what adults do

157
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,494
You couldn't be more wrong

158
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,164
Adults mold society to their vision

159
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,415
They make the rules

160
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,417
They define common sense

161
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,128
They determine what's extraordinary

162
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,048
They use power
to rule the powerless

163
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,258
They use knowledge
to control the ignorant

164
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,178
They use strength
to dominate the weak

165
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,013
That's what adults do

166
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,265
I don't understand

167
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,186
You could have ruled Kivotos

168
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,731
The immense power and
authority this city affords,

169
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:11,152
the Mystics who reside within,

170
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,530
all of it was in your grasp,

171
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,200
even if only temporarily

172
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,954
Yet, you did not hesitate to discard it

173
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,914
Truth, secrets,

174
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,208
power, money, strength

175
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,671
You abandoned it all for nothing, Why?

176
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,467
Even if I told you,
you'd never understand

177
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,141
Then this negotiation is over, Sensei

178
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,603
It's too bad, I like you

179
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,397
But it can't be helped

180
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,150
You'll find Hoshino in a lab

181
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,529
at the Kaiser PMC base
in the Abydos Desert

182
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,282
"Mimesis” revealed the Mystics' other side:

183
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,700
Terror itself

184
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,495
We suspect a living
student could harness it

185
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,583
Hoshino was to be our test subject

186
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,960
You suspect?

187
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,754
Since negotiations have failed,

188
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,882
we will be unable to confirm it

189
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,218
I regret that we must retreat now

190
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,722
- What about Hoshino?
- Do as you wish

191
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,057
Take her

192
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,395
If you can get into the base, that is

193
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:31,107
And if the Director allows it

194
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,777
It was nice talking to you

195
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,655
Let's meet again someday

196
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,702
I wish you some small
measure of luck.

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,749
(Abydos Foreclosure Task Force)

198
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,500
(Abydos Foreclosure Task Force)
A lab at the Kaiser PMC base?

199
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,877
A lab at the Kaiser PMC base?

200
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,754
Yes, I'm sure

201
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,422
Hoshino's there

202
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,634
To think she's being
held in such a place⋯

203
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,179
<i>-We can't waste any time
- Let's rescue her</i>

204
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,805
Right

205
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,557
But wait a moment

206
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,978
What should we say
when we find Hoshino?

207
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,647
That's not as important as—

208
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,815
- We should scold her
- Huh?

209
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,237
She broke her promise
and should be punished

210
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,905
Thoroughly

211
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,574
We should scold her

212
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,873
We'll tell her, "Welcome back!”

213
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,833
And she'll say, "I'm home,”

214
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,379
How embarrassing!
It's like a cheesy youth drama!

215
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,340
Like we're living some
pure, innocent school story

216
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,676
That's not our style!

217
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,261
I'm going to say it

218
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,805
whether Serika does or not

219
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,142
Me too, even if it is embarrassing⋯

220
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,602
Do whatever you want

221
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,439
But I'll never say
something that corny

222
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,943
Okay, but before that, right now—

223
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,902
Right now,

224
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,905
we can't beat them on our own

225
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,324
Then we need to find help

226
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,409
Problem Solver 68?

227
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:08,162
Yes, they've helped us before but⋯

228
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,961
About that⋯

229
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,134
It's been a while, everyone

230
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,594
How have you been, Hifumi?

231
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,306
Good, thanks to you

232
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:31,436
I'm sorry, I wanted to visit you first—

233
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,270
Huh?

234
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,564
Where's Hoshino?

235
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,650
Well, you see⋯

236
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,862
So⋯

237
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,698
That's what happened

238
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,368
Yes, we should've caught it sooner

239
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,370
and stopped Hoshino

240
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,498
But we were just as helpless

241
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,792
So then your visit today has

242
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,754
something to do with Hoshino?

243
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,964
That's right

244
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,260
We need Trinity's help to rescue her

245
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,016
I'll talk to the Tea Party

246
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,563
What should I do?

247
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,358
What do you think, Nagisa?

248
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,985
Which one should I choose?

249
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,489
A strawberry cream shortcake

250
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,492
pairs perfectly with the tea

251
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,286
But I can't give up this Mont Blanc

252
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,246
Well, Nagisa⋯

253
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,500
The Abydos students saved me once

254
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,959
So⋯

255
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,006
That Kaiser PMC company is sure to be

256
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:47,178
a bad influence on our students

257
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,848
- Then will you help them—
- However,

258
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,228
with the treaty signing so near,

259
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,855
we can't afford to be reckless

260
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,486
Can you give us some time?

261
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,864
So they're on hold?

262
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,617
I'm sorry for suggesting this

263
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,619
I knew it wouldn't be easy

264
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,248
It's so hard to get
another school's help

265
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,999
We can't give up

266
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,876
True

267
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:22,797
But the next place
might not help either

268
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,591
Still, we can't give up

269
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,262
It'll be all right

270
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,689
I'm really sorry it's just me

271
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,315
It's okay

272
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,985
I wish Chinatsu could be here too

273
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,446
But our school has its own issues

274
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,077
Thanks for working so hard, Chinatsu

275
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,996
Sorry I'm late

276
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,584
- Would you like a drink?
- Huh?

277
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,752
Th-Thank you

278
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,257
But that's mine⋯

279
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,261
I apologize for making you wait

280
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,306
- But everything's finally sorted⋯
- Excuse me

281
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,808
I'm sorry to disturb your rest,

282
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,685
but there's a problem in the cafeteria

283
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,563
I see, Thank you so much

284
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,817
I'm sorry once again
Enjoy your stay

285
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,071
Is she always running around like that?

286
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,324
Actually, today's better than usual

287
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,828
Anyway,

288
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,831
Where were we?

289
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,502
The head prefect's busy

290
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,253
You can't see her

291
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,338
But⋯

292
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,715
Tell you what

293
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,511
Get down on your knees
and lick my feet like—

294
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,804
Wh-What are you doing?!

295
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:58,434
Don't you have a shred
of dignity?! Or propriety?!

296
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,061
This is an emergency!

297
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,064
He's staring straight at me⋯

298
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,361
Stop it! Let go of me!

299
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,321
Looks like you're having fun

300
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,324
Head Prefect Hina!

301
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,077
If you're bowing that deeply,

302
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,663
there must be a serious problem

303
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,873
Well, that's—
Head Prefect⋯

304
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,918
Sensei was just—
He's not bowing, He's⋯

305
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:24,752
Huh?

306
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,671
⋯licking my feet⋯?

307
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,630
Oh, Hina!

308
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,891
So, the Prefect Team
is on hold too?

309
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,477
Rest assured, I did
everything I could

310
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,356
Our last hope is
Problem Solver 68

311
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,609
But will they accept our request?

312
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,153
Have no fear, This time⋯

313
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,738
Huh?

314
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,117
What's going on now?

315
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,702
This is strange

316
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,539
This is definitely the right address

317
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:05,501
Is this supposed to be
the Problem Solver office?

318
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,837
Could we have made a mistake?

319
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:12,800
If so, we have no idea
where they are now

320
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,386
Another dead end

321
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,763
Let's get out of here

322
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,310
Where are they anyway?

323
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,312
(Problem Solver 68 / CEO: Rikuhachima Aru
Call us anytime!)

324
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,817
- Long time no see, Master
- Huh?

325
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:30,151
(Ramen)

326
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,485
(Ramen)
Ah, welcome

327
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:31,611
(Ramen)

328
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,321
(Ramen)
This food cart looks great

329
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:33,446
(Ramen)

330
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,073
(Ramen)
It feels so nostalgic

331
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:36,198
(Ramen)

332
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,033
(Ramen)
Really?

(Shiba Seki Ramen)

334
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,578
(Shiba Seki Ramen) Shiba Seki
Ramen did start out as a food cart

335
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,372
How should I put it?
I feel young again

336
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,708
I'm glad to see you're well

337
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,961
Now we can eat your Ramen again

338
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,007
If not for that windfall, who
knows what would've happened

339
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,009
You would have figured something out

340
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,928
Well, I couldn't quit, could I?

341
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,892
Plenty of people still want my Ramen

342
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,103
I served the cutest customers earlier

343
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:10,358
They said they were exhausted,
but my Ramen gave them strength

344
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,068
I'm really grateful

345
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,445
How about you all?

346
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,697
Well, we're a bit⋯

347
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,950
We've been asking around for help

348
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:24,663
There's one team left,
but we can't find them

349
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,000
We might have to give up

350
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,921
Master, the check, please

351
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,925
- There they are!
- There they are!

352
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,134
Huh?

353
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:43,307
You want us to fight
Kaiser PMC⋯for free?

354
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,478
There's nothing
in it for us at all?

355
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,273
I'm really sorry about that

356
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,818
Kayoko, take a closer look at Aru

357
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,527
Huh?

358
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,364
"Eating this Ramen is payment enough,”

359
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,324
That's what her face says, right?

360
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,953
That's right!
As expected of Aru

361
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,496
Not a word

362
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,874
She just runs headlong
into hell for a bowl of Ramen

363
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,168
That's what being
hard boiled is all about!

364
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,339
-I'm sorry
- Huh?

365
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,591
But I'll have to think about it

366
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,468
Aru?

367
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,512
Boss, are you serious?

368
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,014
Yeah, I get it

369
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,517
Let's go, everyone

370
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,395
<i>Wait, Aru!</i>

371
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,273
Sensei, sometimes this happens⋯

372
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,108
- It's all right
- Huh?

373
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,486
Those kids will show up
I have faith in them

374
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,738
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

375
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,493
Faith, huh⋯

376
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,499
Right, As long as the shop has
faith in its customers, it'll live on

377
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,085
That's the way it goes

378
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:57,047
If it doesn't work out,
you can always start over

379
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,968
As long as you believe,
the path will continue

380
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,555
Go, Foreclosure Task Force

381
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:05,681
Then⋯

382
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,768
Come back for delicious Ramen!

383
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,107
Is everyone ready?

384
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:15,941
Yes

385
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,485
We can go anytime

386
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:20,279
We've got plenty of ammunition

387
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,364
And we had a good night's sleep

388
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,993
Kaiser PMC can't beat us!

389
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,830
According to Sensei's intel,

390
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,752
Hoshino's in District 51
of the Kaiser PMC base

391
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,963
Then let's move out

392
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,966
All right! Hoshino Rescue Mission⋯

393
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,011
Start!

394
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:06,367
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

395
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:12,164
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

396
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,795
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

397
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,798
With all those laughs we shared⋯

398
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:27,137
Even if⋯those moments were just ordinary

399
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,973
Those days⋯

400
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,476
One more time, one time more,

401
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,980
Knowing they won't come around again!

402
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,525
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

403
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:43,195
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

404
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,824
Would that let me finally forgive

405
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,286
All those regrets we made so willfully?

406
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,622
We only recognize the important things

407
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,793
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

408
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,380
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

409
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:05,718
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

410
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:10,890
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days⋯
