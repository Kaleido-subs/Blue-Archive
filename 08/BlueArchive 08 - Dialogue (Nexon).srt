1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,712
Hurry, hurry!

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:05,881
Wait for me, Serika!

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:10,010
My, my, They sure are excited

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,762
Hey! Be careful!

5
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,013
I know! Don't worry!

6
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,475
- Shall we go too?
- Yeah

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,022
What do you want to see first, Ayane?

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,942
Let's see⋯Maybe the sea turtles?

9
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,986
Huh? Most people go for fish first!

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,864
Right, Shiroko? Hoshino?

11
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,033
Actually I think you're right

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,328
- Then, let's do the seahorses
- That's weird too

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,373
- Just like Shiroko though!
- Definitely!

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,383
The sky blue archive!

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,229
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

16
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,400
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

17
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:10,779
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

18
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,575
Those clouds like whales are always changing

19
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:18,620
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

20
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:24,001
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

21
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,213
If I were here alone, here without all of you

22
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,301
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

23
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,303
A fateful coterie

24
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:42,269
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

25
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:51,194
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

26
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:56,992
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

27
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:08,086
Because this is the only place where we belong

28
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,939
So cool! Awesome!

29
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,941
It's like we're under the seal

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,070
C'mon, there's sharks over there!

31
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,031
Hey! Careful not to trip!

32
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,451
This aquarium is super big

33
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,787
It'd be hard to see everything in one day

34
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,538
Really? It's that big?

35
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,792
She's right⋯

36
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,170
On top of the penguin and
dolphin areas,

37
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:54,049
there are all kinds of rides
and exhibits here!

38
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,260
What should we do?
Go through everything super fast?

39
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,889
Whoa there, it's fine to take our time

40
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,850
She's right, We can always
come back, after all

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,646
Heehee, I'm glad everyone's
having so much fun!

42
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,730
- Yup!
- Yeah!

43
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,903
Look at it gulping!

44
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,156
- Is it breathing?
- Probably

45
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,367
Now that you mention it,

46
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,870
how do fish breathe underwater?

47
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,834
Fish have special organs
that extract oxygen from the water

48
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,169
You've heard of gills, right?

49
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,130
Water goes in their mouth

50
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,216
and they extract the oxygen
through their gills

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,469
They take in oxygen and
then expel carbon dioxide

52
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,764
In that sense, fish aren't
so different from us

53
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
We look different
on the outside,

54
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,102
but we're similar on the inside

55
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,187
Well, there are creatures like whales

56
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,733
that just hold their breath while
they dive underwater, though

57
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,568
Oh, but just to clarify,

58
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,738
whales aren't fish
They're mammals!

59
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,576
What's wrong?
Have you all gone mute?

60
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,288
No, it's just⋯
I was taken aback, I guess?

61
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,541
Hoshino started spouting
some smart people stuff

62
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,460
- Unexpected
- What do you mean?!

63
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,962
Impressive! You really know your stuff

64
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,466
Hoshino knows everything
there is to know about fish

65
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,345
I wouldn't go that far

66
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,184
Jellyfish really are the best!

67
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,812
I agree! Their little glow is so cute!

68
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,982
It's not that they're
reflecting light, right?

69
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,068
No, they glow by themselves

70
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,863
Fascinating

71
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,324
But if they glow in the ocean,

72
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,451
isn't it easy for other fish to catch them?

73
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,287
Well, that's a bit complicated,

74
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,665
but sometimes their
light actually protects them!

75
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,877
They even use it to scare off enemies

76
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,174
Hey, hey! Let's go to the tropical fish now!

77
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,635
I heard they have lots of different species!

78
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,179
That sounds great, Let's go!

79
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,681
Oh, cool!

80
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,142
Look at these guys
Don't they look⋯

81
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,644
- Cute
- Tasty

82
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,190
How could you say that?!
Are you serious, Hoshino?

83
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,068
They just look so meaty!

84
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,946
And I bet they taste even
better than they look!

85
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,366
Absolutely not! Right, Ayane?

86
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,036
I-I wouldn't want to eat them either

87
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,454
They're cute⋯

88
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,581
Think about it, Ayane

89
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,376
If we ate them,

90
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,837
we'd save on food costs

91
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,755
Th-That's true

92
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,299
What the heck!
That's barbaric, Shiroko!

93
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,426
What about you, Nonomi?

94
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,011
Me?

95
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,222
They're adorable, of course!

96
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,765
Nonomi!

97
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,643
But they do look tasty too

98
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,729
Everyone! Did you wait long?

99
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
What's all the commotion about?

100
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,359
- Serika
- Yeah

101
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,904
Should we make Sensei decide?

102
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,073
We should, Hoshino

103
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,701
Decide what?

104
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,286
You see, Sensei

105
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,246
It's about these tropical fish here

106
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,956
- They look tasty, right?
- They look cute, right?

107
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,750
- Which is it, Sensei?
- Which is it, Sensei?

108
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,210
Ah, that's⋯

109
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,755
I, um⋯

110
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,718
Y-You guys⋯are the cute ones⋯?

111
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,638
He's no good

112
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,473
She's right, Sensei

113
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,727
Sorry! Let me try again!

114
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,981
This one's called "Old Timer"!

115
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,358
It's just like Hoshino!

116
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,277
What? Not at all

117
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,404
When I imagine it,

118
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,699
Hoshino is rather like a jellyfish

119
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,035
Always relaxed and such

120
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,121
Really? What about you, Nonomi?

121
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,789
Well⋯

122
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,833
In my opinion,

123
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,753
maybe⋯a penguin?

124
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,504
You think so?

125
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,299
Yes! There's something similar about them

126
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,761
Especially their cute little mannerisms!

127
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,730
- That jump was amazing!
- Yeah

128
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,650
The trajectory was well above our heads!

129
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,113
Hey, look! They're gonna
jump even higher!

130
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,074
Sensei's having fun

131
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,077
Yes! He's like a little kid

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,162
Guys, there they go again!

133
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,587
- Wow, How impressive!
- Yeah

134
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,677
- Hey, Hoshino
- Huh?

135
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,679
Do you have a moment?

136
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,307
What's up, Shiroko?

137
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,519
You wanted some
one-on-one time, huh?

138
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,647
Oh! Are you trying to
profess your love?

139
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,482
No, Nothing like that

140
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,859
What a shame

141
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,490
You know, I was thinking
earlier during the show

142
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,618
that Shiroko really
reminds me of a dolphin

143
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,495
What do you mean?

144
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,997
Well, Nonomi and the others were

145
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,376
guessing what animal I look most like

146
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,755
You're so cute and athletic,

147
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,799
so I was like, a dolphin!

148
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,218
- Is that so?
- Heck yes!

149
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,556
What would you
pick for me, Shiroko?

150
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,102
Whale

151
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,606
Wait, wait, But I'm so small!

152
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,984
Isn't that totally off?

153
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,485
Not at all

154
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,738
You're like a whale

155
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,824
Swimming while asleep

156
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,910
It's impossible to see all of you,
no matter how close we get

157
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,203
<i>And...</i>

158
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,707
You're always holding your breath

159
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:07,088
You said you were
napping the other day,

160
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,215
but you were lying, weren't you?

161
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,468
Shiroko

162
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,095
Is there anything I can do?

163
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:14,888
Eh?

164
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,640
You're always⋯

165
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,435
shouldering the heavy burdens on your own

166
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,774
I want to help you with those burdens,

167
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,652
just like you did for me

168
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,368
You really are kind, Shiroko

169
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,620
Hoshino

170
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,499
But your kindness⋯

171
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,376
might make this
old-timer fall for you!

172
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,131
I'm so blessed⋯

173
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,635
to have such a wonderful junior

174
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,347
You two get along so well

175
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,810
Shiroko professed her love for me

176
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:02,894
Oh my!

177
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,730
Let's go to the feeding area now, Ayane!

178
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,441
Ah, yes! Which fish⋯

179
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,494
That's cute

180
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,829
Are you going to buy it?

181
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,664
Oh? Well--

182
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,707
It's kinda childish⋯

183
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,127
Not at all

184
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,963
This one's humongous!

185
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,549
Am I gonna be able to carry it to the club room?

186
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,218
More importantly, where
would you put it?!

187
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,595
- Good point
- Sensei will figure it out

188
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,099
Hoshino and the whale are so cute together

189
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,608
Do you see anything
you like, Shiroko?

190
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,484
Well⋯

191
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,487
This is cute

192
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,116
Shiroko's pick is a little plain, no?

193
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,327
Maybe she's worried about money?

194
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,874
Well, you don't have to
worry about that

195
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,333
Right, Sensei?

196
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,253
Um, you're right

197
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,631
How about a little keychain, though?

198
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,092
It's okay, right? Sensei?

199
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,887
Y-Yeah, but⋯

200
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,847
Seeenseiii

201
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,103
O-Of course

202
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,688
Great!

203
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,356
Thanks, Sensei

204
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,276
As long as everyone's happy

205
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,532
Hey! Let's take a group picture
since we're all here!

206
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,576
- That sounds good!
- Let's

207
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,371
I can take it for you,
so stand right there

208
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,416
Huh? Shouldn't Sensei
be in it as well?

209
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,628
- No, I⋯
- That won't do

210
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,672
Why're you acting all shy now?

211
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,841
You belong in the picture as well!

212
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,218
You're gonna feel
left out if you don't!

213
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,721
But still⋯

214
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,806
Do you want me to take it for you?

215
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,310
Yuuka!

216
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,313
What a coincidence, Sensei

217
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,982
Thank you again for last time

218
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,485
It's been a while!
Have you been well?

219
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,278
Yes! We owe you

220
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:21,866
Since you're here, there's
something I need to tell you⋯

221
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,787
Actually, maybe next time

222
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,875
Um, would you like us
to take your picture?

223
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,418
Oh! Are you sure?

224
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,712
In that case, yes please!

225
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,424
Everyone! Are you ready?

226
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,592
- Yes!
- Yeah

227
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,344
Okay, Here we go!

228
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,680
Say cheese!

229
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,865
I hope we have many
more moments like this

230
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,834
So why can't I shake this feeling⋯?

231
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,359
Am I⋯

232
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:43,197
living up to your legacy?

233
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,950
Yume

234
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,078
Hoshino?

235
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,129
Am I imagining things?

236
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,682
Just now...

237
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,230
(Abydos Foreclosure Task Force)
Are you sure this is Hoshino?!

238
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,358
Her side profile!
What a nice picture

239
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,443
She's naturally pretty!

240
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,779
Oh! We never take pictures

241
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,407
Should we post these
to our MomoTalk group chat?

242
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:11,452
That way everybody
could upload their pictures!

243
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,664
Good morning

244
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,457
Mm, Good morning

245
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,045
You looking for Hoshino?
She's not here yet

246
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,798
I bet she's passed out somewhere

247
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,174
Is that so?

248
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:30,096
Shiroko! Would you mind sharing
your pictures from yesterday?

249
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,055
Sure

250
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,726
Come to think of it, we only
posted the group picture

251
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,980
Where was this?

252
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,523
At the specimen exhibit

253
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,067
They said I could touch it

254
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,903
The way you're holding
it makes it seem like

255
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,864
you caught the starfish yourself

256
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,659
If anyone could do it,
it'd be Shiroko

257
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,037
I have always wanted to try fishing

258
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,499
Perhaps we can take a trip
out to the sea next time

259
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,877
I thought the underwater
tunnel was super cool!

260
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,463
It made me want to try out diving!

261
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,133
Okay! Then let's make
that happen next time

262
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,093
Then⋯

263
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,555
Hey, hey! Didja all sleep well?

264
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,640
You're late, Hoshino!

265
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,475
Aw, sorry!

266
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,561
I was so tired and just so comfy

267
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,980
I couldn't get out of bed!

268
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,649
Anyways! What're we up to?

269
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,861
We're looking at all
our aquarium pictures

270
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,529
Ooh, fun!

271
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,740
I wanna see!

272
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,035
Didn't you take any pictures, Hoshino?

273
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,246
This old-timer can't handle all the
newfangled technology these days

274
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,207
Is it that complicated⋯?

275
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,750
Don't worry

276
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,920
I took lots of pics of Hoshino

277
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,880
and everyone else

278
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,715
You always do this, Nonomi!

279
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,383
Is what I'd normally say,

280
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,137
but I saw you were taking
pics of everyone but yourself,

281
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,431
so I took a bunch of you!

282
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,892
I also took a lot
of you, Nonomi

283
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,312
Serika! Ayane!

284
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,439
Thank you so much

285
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,776
I'm delighted you care
about me that much

286
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,410
Hey, Shiroko, you
don't want to join?

287
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,287
Ah, I—

288
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,498
Of course you two are included!

289
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,085
(Foreclosure Task Force
Daily Meeting)

290
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,002
(Foreclosure Task Force
Daily Meeting) Well, everyone,

291
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,419
Well, everyone,

292
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,589
today's daily meeting is adjourned

293
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,799
-Yes
- Okay

294
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,134
See you tomorrow

295
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,054
We're heading out first

296
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,808
I'll say goodbye to Sensei before I leave

297
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:39,725
Okay

298
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,482
Time for me to get more shut-eye too

299
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,026
Hoshino

300
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,987
Hm? What's up?

301
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,451
Where were you this morning?

302
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,787
I already told you!

303
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,915
I wasn't anywhere, I just overslept

304
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,709
Really?

305
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,336
What's wrong, Shiroko?

306
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,922
- Is something bothering you?
- Yeah

307
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,635
I swear I saw you
downtown this morning

308
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,515
You probably saw someone else!

309
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,603
There are lots of girls
that look like me, after all

310
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:28,149
You gotta be real tired to mistake
me for someone else, Shiroko!

311
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,443
- Go take a nap—
- Hoshino!

312
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,320
Are you hiding something?

313
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,823
(Sensei's Room)

314
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,575
(Sensei's Room)
What? My pictures?

315
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,829
Yes! So I can send
them to the others!

316
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,664
Oh, thank you

317
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,542
Owww

318
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,253
That hurts, Shiroko

319
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,922
What is this? Hoshino!

320
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,884
Just some piece of paper

321
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,137
Don't worry about it
It's nothing for now

322
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,181
You expect me to not worry?

323
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,350
And what do you mean "for now"?

324
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,062
Well, what I mean is⋯

325
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,734
Hoshino! Shiroko!

326
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,487
What're you two doing?

327
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,364
It's that⋯

328
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,866
What on earth is happening?

329
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,160
Shiroko

330
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,954
Sorry, Can we have a moment?

331
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,794
That's impossible!

332
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,588
There's no secrets

333
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,509
between the members of
the Foreclosure Task Force

334
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:41,180
We're all in this together,
no matter what

335
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,599
- But—
- My bad, my bad!

336
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,311
It's okay, It's not a big
deal in the slightest

337
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,439
Shiroko worries too much

338
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,611
Well, I really appreciate
the concern though

339
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,074
Wait, Hoshino
We didn't finish—

340
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,158
Shiroko

341
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,203
I don't know what happened,

342
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,664
but I think it'd be best
to give her some space

343
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,624
But Hoshino⋯

344
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,879
Everyone has some things
they'd rather not talk about

345
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,429
Hoshino

346
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,232
Thank you, Shiroko

347
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,156
Regardless, I⋯

348
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,784
The time has come

349
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,037
There'll be no going back after this

350
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,874
You won't be able to
stop halfway, after all

351
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:17,401
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

352
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,157
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

353
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,787
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

354
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,790
With all those laughs we shared⋯

355
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:38,130
Even if⋯those moments were just ordinary

356
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,965
Those days⋯

357
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,469
One more time, one time more,

358
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,972
Knowing they won't come around again!

359
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,518
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

360
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,188
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

361
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,775
Would that let me finally forgive

362
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,278
All those regrets we made so willfully?

363
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,657
We only recognize the important things

364
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,786
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

365
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,331
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

366
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,710
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

367
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:21,924
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days⋯

368
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,990
Are you okay, Shiroko?

369
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,450
Yeah, I've calmed down a bit

370
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,330
Sensei, this

371
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,915
What is it?

372
00:22:59,253 --> 00:22:59,962
(Withdrawal Form)

373
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,046
(Withdrawal Form)
This is⋯

374
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,883
Hoshino is hiding
something from us

375
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,636
But I⋯

376
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,015
It's not that

377
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,517
Hoshino doesn't trust you

378
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,813
Are you okay with me handling this?

379
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,400
I want to help Hoshino too

380
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,362
If you say so, Sensei

381
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,489
Sometimes, the closer you are,

382
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,619
the more you trust each other,
the harder it is to speak up

383
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,539
Yeah

384
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,626
Thank you, Sensei
