1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,213
(Prefect)

2
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,303
Aru, Aru!

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,181
Oh, geez, We need to
get out of here fast

4
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,226
I didn't think they'd
chase us all the way here

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,187
There's no way⋯ Why?!

6
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:23,357
Why're they attacking unprovoked?
This is still Abydos!

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:27,653
But are they targeting us?
Or Problem Solver 68?

8
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,239
Sensei, those students are⋯

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,281
I know

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,116
They're⋯

11
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,205
The Gehenna Prefect Team

12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,335
The sky blue archive!

13
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:56,223
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

14
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:00,435
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

15
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:04,731
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

16
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,569
Those clouds like whales are always changing

17
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,614
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

18
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:17,995
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

19
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,207
If I were here alone, here without all of you

20
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,295
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

21
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,255
A fateful coterie

22
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:36,263
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:45,188
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,986
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:02:02,080
Because this is the only place where we belong

26
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,511
Sensei, it's too dangerous
Go find cover behind us

27
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,472
Okay, Thank you

28
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,434
What a bother

29
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,269
Patience, Iori

30
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,688
Why do we have to wait?

31
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,857
Because there is such
a thing as procedure

32
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:33,278
So much red tape just to catch
a handful of delinquents

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,988
If anyone wants to
get in our way, then⋯

34
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,240
First, we need to explain the circumstances

35
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,077
and assess the opponent's position

36
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,453
We'll negotiate from there

37
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,664
If we can't come to an understanding,
then we can fight

38
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,500
Is all of that really necessary?

39
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,293
This is foreign territory

40
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,546
Even if it wasn't directed at them,
our earlier attack wouldn't have

41
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,799
gone unpunished anywhere else

42
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,384
I get it

43
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,136
Then I'll head over
and explain the situation

44
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,346
Wait a second, Iori!

45
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,682
It's okay, Leave it to me

46
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,143
Hey, Aru

47
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,774
— Aru
— Good morning, Aru!

48
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,071
Boss, we need to hurry up and leave

49
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,907
Leave? Why?

50
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,535
The Prefect Team's here

51
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,245
The Prefect Team⋯?

52
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,330
- Why are they—
- Keep it down

53
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,791
They'll find us if you're too loud

54
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,421
You still can't get a hold of Hoshino?

55
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,841
No⋯ She's never gone
dark on us like this before

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,555
Hey, Abydos High School students

57
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,308
What is the Gehenna
Prefect Team doing here?

58
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,561
And why did you bomb us?

59
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,814
About that, Some criminals
ran away to your district,

60
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,941
and we were teaching them a lesson

61
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,694
Are you talking about Problem Solver 68?

62
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,820
Exactly

63
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,323
So we really don't have
any beef with you guys

64
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,242
That's why I'll let you off the hook

65
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,202
if you back down right now

66
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,247
What if we don't?

67
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,168
We're up against the Prefect Team

68
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,045
Fighting them might
not end well for us

69
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,133
It could also cause
huge political issues

70
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,677
I'm frustrated with this situation too,

71
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,555
but the gap in power is too big

72
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,016
Wouldn't it be wiser
to back down for now?

73
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,559
We can't do that

74
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,855
She's right, We still need to
make Problem Solver 68 pay

75
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,814
But⋯

76
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,942
The master was injured, and he
had nothing to do with this

77
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,777
Serika⋯

78
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,492
We won't stand down

79
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,329
Those kids turned down
the Prefect Team's offer

80
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,915
Seriously? They don't know
what they're getting into

81
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,917
Aru, now's our chance

82
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,336
Let's leave while
they're distracted

83
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,505
Aru?

84
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,467
Hey, To continue regretting
something you've already done

85
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,260
isn't very hard boiled, is it?

86
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,138
Blaming others for
your own mistakes

87
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,058
and running away isn't
very hard boiled, either

88
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,185
What are you saying?
Now isn't the time⋯

89
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,520
An outlaw⋯

90
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,689
Being a real outlaw means

91
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,568
not compromising our beliefs
no matter who our opponent is

92
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,153
Aru

93
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,660
Is that your final answer?

94
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,494
Yes

95
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,623
I did all this diplomacy
for nothing

96
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,959
Your funeral!

97
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,293
Ayane!

98
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,589
Iori, not again

99
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,687
Not bad

100
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,565
Shiroko!

101
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,242
How dare you!

102
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,081
Serika!

103
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,966
Just a bunch of nobodies

104
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,800
Stop!

105
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,721
Who are you?

106
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,306
Hold your fire, Iori!

107
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,350
Run, Sensei!

108
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,643
Sensei?

109
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,854
Are you, by chance,
from Schale?

110
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,483
Keep your guard up

111
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,736
Is everyone okay?

112
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,820
Y-Yes

113
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,114
It really is you, Sensei

114
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,534
I didn't expect to run into you here

115
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,619
You're⋯

116
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,121
It's been a while, Chinatsu

117
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,124
If I had known you were here⋯

118
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,251
My apologies

119
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,713
I'm Okusora Ayane from the
Abydos Foreclosure Task Force

120
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,507
You may be the Gehenna Prefect Team,

121
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,010
but what justification do
you have to attack us?

122
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,261
It's because⋯

123
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,805
Allow me to answer that question

124
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,436
Hello, Abydos students

125
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,149
I'm the senior administrator
of the Gehenna Prefect Team,

126
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,985
Amau Ako

127
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,864
Let's start over

128
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,033
Foreclosure Task Force members,

129
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,870
I apologize for any inconvenience
caused by this incident

130
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,206
Don't you think

131
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,334
you should lower your weapons
before saying such things?

132
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,794
Oh, Yes, yes

133
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,380
Everyone, at ease

134
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,466
They actually did it

135
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,300
Now,

136
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,554
allow me to apologize
for our foolish actions

137
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,973
Foolish actions?

138
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,558
I just followed orders

139
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,559
Iori

140
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,896
Do you know where to
find the self-reflection form?

141
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,314
A-Ako!

142
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,444
Did your orders include
firing indiscriminately

143
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,989
as you pleased?

144
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,699
Not exactly, but—

145
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,618
And this isn't Gehenna

146
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,162
Since you're in another school's district,

147
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,083
it should be a given to
proceed with caution, no?

148
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,128
Let me ask again, Iori

149
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,922
Do you know where to
find the self-reflection form?

150
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,260
In the left drawer of your desk

151
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,429
Please complete it when you return

152
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,848
Now, back to business

153
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:39,686
We're here to apprehend
criminals from our district

154
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,940
Will you cooperate
with the Prefect Team?

155
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,484
Is that a request? Or⋯

156
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,404
It's a request,

157
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,740
at least for now

158
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,993
We won't cooperate

159
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,953
Oh my, Why not?

160
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,747
No matter your justification,

161
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,915
this is our district

162
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,293
Openly attacking us like this is

163
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,961
a clear violation of the law

164
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,882
Problem Solver 68's discipline
falls under our jurisdiction

165
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,884
Sensei of Schale⋯

166
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,053
Are you of the same opinion?

167
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,722
Yes, For this matter,

168
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,558
I'm on their side

169
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,605
I really did want to
resolve this peacefully,

170
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,357
but I suppose we have no other choice

171
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,360
Everyone, prepare for battle!

172
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,780
Huh?

173
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,158
Wh-What?

174
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,367
An ambush?!

175
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,622
Calm down!
Secure the perimeter!

176
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,166
You dare attack Aru?

177
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,001
Unforgivable!

178
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,254
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

179
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,551
Iori!

180
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,931
Hey! Long time no see

181
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,557
All according to plan

182
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,895
Shall we have some fun?

183
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,981
You guys!

184
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,400
- How dare you attack the master—
- Sorry

185
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,656
I'm surprised you gave
yourself up so easily

186
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,451
But it saves us the trouble
of hunting you down

187
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,792
A double envelopment?

188
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,962
Ah, I thought it was too easy

189
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,923
It appears this unexpected encounter
has gotten out of hand

190
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:36,344
From chasing Problem Solver 68
to running into Schale's Sensei⋯

191
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,388
That's pretty shameless, Ako

192
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,140
- Huh?
- Kayoko?

193
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,975
None of this is a coincidence

194
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,353
You were aiming for this exact
result from the beginning

195
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,439
Your methods are inefficient

196
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,984
So many forces, just
to confront Abydos⋯

197
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,654
The Prefect Team never
handles business like this

198
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,990
Your goal is Schale

199
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,869
From the beginning, you came
all this way to target Sensei

200
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:01,703
Me?

201
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,538
What does she mean?

202
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,208
As expected of you, Kayoko
Always so clever

203
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,588
Since it's come to this,
allow me to explain

204
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,340
It all started with the Tea Party

205
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,179
Gehenna has a long-standing
rivalry with Trinity

206
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:23,933
Trinity's student council got
a hold of a report about Schale,

207
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,812
according to findings from
our Intelligence Committee

208
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:33,067
At that time, I had no idea
who or what Schale was,

209
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,695
but since the Tea Party
was privy to that intel,

210
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,072
I made it my business to find out

211
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,368
That's when I remembered a report
Chinatsu had submitted

212
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,079
But I sent that report so long ago--

213
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,081
The General Student Council president

214
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,668
left Sensei at the head
of this shadowy organization-

215
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,589
Who knows what kind of
influence it might wield?

216
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,927
Therefore, at least until the Eden
Treaty is safely concluded,

217
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,765
we plan to put Sensei
under our protection

218
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,059
And just who's calling those shots?

219
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,603
Do you think we'll surrender
Sensei without a fight?

220
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,314
We're the ones protecting Sensei

221
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,943
I expected as much

222
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,113
But we need him too,
so there's no other choice

223
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,782
If the head prefect
hears of this,

224
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,992
I'll have to complete the
self-reflection form with Iori

225
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,160
Ako

226
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,080
Do you think you can take
us on with just you five?

227
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,373
It's nine people!

228
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,543
They're not here for you guys!

229
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,505
Running away without repaying
our debts at a time like this?

230
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,091
That's third-rate villain stuff

231
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,260
How eloquent, Aru!

232
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,181
I won't be able to rest easy until we've put
that cocky Prefect Team in their place

233
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,350
- Yeah
- That's right

234
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,813
⋯Kuromi Serika

235
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,733
We should know each other's names
if we're going to fight together

236
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,944
I'm not just "Part-Timer,"

237
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,655
Rikuhachima Aru

238
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,076
- Onikata Kayoko
- Asagi Mutsuki

239
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,161
I'm Igusa Haruka

240
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,788
Nice to meet you

241
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,665
And I'm Izayoi Nonomi

242
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,001
My name is Okusora Ayane

243
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,128
Sunaookami Shiroko

244
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,384
Listen up, there's no
turning back now

245
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,595
Even if you beg, offer money,

246
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,972
or lick our feet⋯

247
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,057
That's a tempting offer,

248
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,310
but I'll have to decline this time

249
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,231
I never expected
you all to join forces

250
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,899
Well, fine

251
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:41,195
We'll show you how terrifying
the Prefect Team is—

252
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,492
Enough yapping

253
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,620
Charge!

254
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,043
Nonomi, Haruka,
head to three o'clock!

255
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:55,835
- Yes!
- Yes!

256
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,378
Serika, Mutsuki

257
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,005
Take our nine o'clock!

258
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,131
Leave it to us!

259
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,591
Shiroko, Aru

260
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,926
Advance forward!
Twelve o'clock!

261
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,136
-Yes
- Okay

262
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,138
Ayane and Kayoko,
provide support!

263
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,014
- Yes
- Okay

264
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,810
Haruka, what should we do?

265
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,896
For now, I'll take the lead

266
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,980
Wait!

267
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:16,981
- Please die
- Haruka!

268
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:17,982
Please die

269
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,075
S-S-Sorry

270
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,786
No, don't worry about it

271
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,455
Let's go, Part-Timer

272
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,880
You're pretty good, Part-Timer

273
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,424
- That goes without saying
- Well then,

274
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,802
shall we continue?

275
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,345
Here they come again!

276
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,183
Seriously?

277
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,559
Shoot!

278
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,607
The rats come crawling out

279
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,734
You won't get away!

280
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,703
As expected, you're skilled, Haruka!

281
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:16,165
Not at all, It's thanks
to your support

282
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,417
No, not at all

283
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,555
Drop your weapon and surrender

284
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,355
Playing games and sneaking around?

285
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,731
Just give up and come out!

286
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,819
Fast!

287
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,571
Final blow!

288
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,367
Counting on you, Part-Timer

289
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,535
What?

290
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,789
I told you, my name isn't Part-Timer!

291
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,181
Now then, what to do?

292
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,767
Who said something about a rat?

293
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,270
Damn, I can't believe they
pushed me to this point

294
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,646
I'll crush you!

295
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,815
What're you waiting for?
Bring it on!

296
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,987
Enemies at both 3 and 9 o'clock
have been taken down!

297
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,364
Good! That just leave our 12!

298
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,158
Shiroko, Aru

299
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,618
Just a little more!

300
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,537
The meddlers got in the way earlier,

301
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,665
but what would've happened
if we'd fought back there?

302
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,668
Isn't it obvious?

303
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,588
Yes, It is obvious

304
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,633
Of course we'd win!

305
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,013
They're coming!

306
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,146
Open fire!

307
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,656
Shiroko, we need to close
the distance!

308
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,786
Even as a team,

309
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,747
what can you do in the
face of such sheer power?

310
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,725
Did we get them?

311
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,406
This is it!

312
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,462
Looks like you won't give up Sensei

313
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,506
that easily, hm?

314
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,010
You're still talking
big in this situation?

315
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,970
Won't you admit defeat?

316
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,098
You still don't get it?

317
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,518
You'll have no choice
but to accept our terms

318
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,104
I still have plenty more troops behind—

319
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,480
- Ako
- Huh?

320
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,276
Head Prefect Hina!

321
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,738
Explain very clearly the situation here

322
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,614
Um, well⋯

323
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,576
We're apprehending criminal students⋯

324
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,203
You mean Problem Solver 68?

325
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,622
Where are they?

326
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,499
What do you mean?
They're right there⋯

327
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,834
Huh?

328
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,712
No way, They were just here!

329
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,632
Head Prefect,
I'll explain everything

330
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,509
No need
I got the gist of it

331
00:18:56,052 --> 00:19:00,473
Ako, we're the Prefect Team,
not the student council

332
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,391
I know, but⋯

333
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,560
We'll discuss this later

334
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,645
You're on probation until then

335
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,522
Understood

336
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,525
Well then

337
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,861
Gehenna Head Prefect

338
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,281
Do you fully understand
the situation here?

339
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,200
Deploying forces

340
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,662
in another school's district
without prior notice,

341
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,581
and engaging in combat with
students from said school

342
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,042
- Yes, that means⋯
- However

343
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,046
You also interfered with the
Prefect Team's official duties

344
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,547
Didn't you?

345
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,263
Oh boy, here we go again
with another commotion

346
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,640
Hoshino!

347
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,642
Where have you been all this time?

348
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,812
Sorry, sorry, I was taking a nap

349
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,188
A nap?

350
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,857
Hoshino from Abydos

351
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,611
Could it be Takanashi Hoshino?

352
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,117
I'm not sure what happened,

353
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,327
but why did you bring
all these kids here?

354
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,954
Head Prefect

355
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,249
You've changed a lot
since you were a first year

356
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,584
I almost didn't recognize you

357
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,379
Huh? You know me?

358
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,047
Back when I was
on the Intelligence Committee,

359
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:19,552
I had a pretty good grasp
of the key students in each district

360
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,347
An old-timer like me was that famous?

361
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,099
Takanashi Hoshino

362
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,476
I couldn't forget you even if I tried

363
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:31,981
I thought you left Abydos
after that incident

364
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,399
I see now

365
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,569
- That's why Schale⋯
- What?

366
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,572
If you don't articulate
your thoughts clearly,

367
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,699
you might put me in a tough spot

368
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,953
Prepare to withdraw

369
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,664
W-We're withdrawing?!

370
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,417
Head Prefect?

371
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,796
For deploying forces
without prior notice,

372
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,383
and causing a disturbance
in another school's district,

373
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,053
I, Sorasaki Hina, would like to

374
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,349
officially apologize to the
Abydos Foreclosure Task Force

375
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,394
We're withdrawing, Let's go

376
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,353
Yes

377
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,460
Sensei, what was that about?

378
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,172
Kaiser Corporation has
been up to something

379
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:42,843
in the desert of Abydos

380
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,138
Sensei?

381
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,392
Oh my, This old-timer still
has no idea what's going on

382
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,852
What exactly happened?

383
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,522
Get it together, Hoshino

384
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,775
She's right! You can't just disappear
at such a critical moment

385
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,904
Sensei, they're being mean to me!

386
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,991
Then, let's head back

387
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,869
Ugh, I'm tired

388
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:31,392
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

389
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,189
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

390
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,820
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

391
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,781
With all those laughs we shared⋯

392
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:52,162
Even if⋯those moments were just ordinary

393
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,956
Those days⋯

394
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,501
One more time, one time more,

395
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,963
Knowing they won't come around again!

396
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,508
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

397
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,137
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

398
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,807
Would that let me finally forgive

399
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,269
All those regrets we made so willfully?

400
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,647
We only recognize the important things

401
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,776
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

402
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,322
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

403
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,701
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

404
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,873
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days⋯
