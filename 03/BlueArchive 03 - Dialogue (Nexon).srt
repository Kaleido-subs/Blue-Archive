1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,759
Hello, Problem Solver 68.

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,260
Rikuhachima speaking.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,222
Yes, of course.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:17,017
We specialize in intelligence
as well as muscle for conflict.

5
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,603
We'll do the crime
if you've got the dime.

6
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,733
Very well. Understood.

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,364
Problem Solver 68 is
on the job.

8
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,369
The sky blue archive!

9
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,215
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

10
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:52,427
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

11
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,723
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

12
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:00,394
Those clouds like whales are always changing

13
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,606
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,987
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
is a taste so divine

15
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,241
If I were here alone, here without all of you

16
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:18,287
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

17
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,289
A fateful coterie

18
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:28,255
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

19
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:37,222
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

20
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:42,978
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

21
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:54,114
Because this is the only place where we belong

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,294
Ayane, what is this?

23
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,212
I found this yesterday

24
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,342
inside one of the Kata-Kata
Helmet Gang's armored vehicles.

25
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,260
According to my investigation,

26
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,805
these shells are supposed
to be totally prohibited.

27
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,934
How did the Helmet Gang
even get this kind of stuff?

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,895
The black market, maybe?

29
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,188
Could be.

30
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,859
But wouldn't they be difficult
to find, let alone afford?

31
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,447
Sounds like they've got
themselves a backer.

32
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,618
By investigating how
these parts were distributed,

33
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,996
we could pin down who's
helping the Helmet Gang.

34
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:43,955
Right.

35
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:48,168
Plus we might figure out
the reason they've been targeting

36
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,253
our school over and over again.

37
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,758
So, everyone.

38
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,427
Let's start our morning meeting.

39
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,931
Sensei will also
be joining us today

40
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,517
so please be serious for once.

41
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,812
What? You make it sound
as if we're never serious!

42
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,733
Welcome to Abydos,
Sensei.

43
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,276
Thanks!

44
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,156
Are there any suggestions
on what the Foreclosure Task Force

45
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,450
should do for our next move?

46
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,618
Me, me!

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,371
First-year Kuromi Serika
has the floor.

48
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,457
As the Foreclosure Task
Force's accountant,

49
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:32,170
let me remind you all that our
school is on the brink of bankruptcy.

50
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,132
Just catching wanted criminals,

51
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,135
or taking on part-time jobs
won't nearly be enough.

52
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,471
So I say let's go for the jackpot!

53
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,849
And that jackpot is...

54
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,560
This right here!

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,018
(Germanium Bracelet)
This right here!

56
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,853
(Germanium Bracelet)

57
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:48,520
(Germanium Bracelet)
Overruled.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,521
(Germanium Bracelet)

59
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,107
Serika, that's a
pyramid scheme.

60
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,734
It'll never work.

61
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,574
(Germanium Bracelet)

62
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,617
No way...

63
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,537
I already bought two of them.

64
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,499
Serika's a little gullible.

65
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,042
It's so cute!

66
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,087
So, anyone else?

67
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,173
- Here, here!
- All right.

68
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,718
Third-year
Takanashi Hoshino, speaking.

69
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,220
Please, please be serious.

70
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,973
Our school's biggest problem...

71
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:29,102
is that we only have five of us here.

72
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:29,728
Hm.

73
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,231
A school's strength
lies in its student body.

74
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,274
Therefore...

75
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,444
we need more students.

76
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,991
Wise words, but what's your plan?

77
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,951
Easy peasy.

78
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,705
We hijack buses from other schools.

79
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,123
What?!

80
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,167
Stealing school buses?

81
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,420
We threaten the passengers
to sign transfers

82
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,672
if they want to get off the bus.

83
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,676
Then watch as our
enrollment numbers skyrocket.

84
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,971
Sounds like a solid plan.

85
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,765
Who's the target?

86
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,434
Trinity? Or Gehenna?

87
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,685
Millennium?

88
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,729
Overruled!

89
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,357
Take this more seriously!

90
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,236
Will the students really
sign transfers under duress?

91
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,656
Not to mention how the other schools'
student councils would respond.

92
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,991
Yeah, you're right...

93
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,996
Please remember to think
before you speak, everyone.

94
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,041
Hey, Ayane. I have an idea.

95
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,086
Speak, Second-year
Sunaookami Shiroko.

96
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,297
Let's rob a bank.

97
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,298
What?!

98
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,634
N-Not another crime!

99
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,428
It's the surest method.

100
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,263
(Abydos First Central Bank)

101
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,431
(Abydos First Central Bank) Our
target is the First Central Bank downtown.

102
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,432
Our target is the
First Central Bank downtown.

103
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,228
I've already scouted
the location of the vault,

104
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:57,399
the guards' patrols, and
the route of the cash trucks.

105
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,984
And of course...

106
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,151
Oh my!

107
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,070
Did you make these yourself, Shiroko?

108
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,656
We'll look just like masked wrestlers.

109
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,576
You really thought this through, Shiroko.

110
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,453
This looks great.

111
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,956
Life's all about shooting your shot.

112
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,666
Right, Serika?

113
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,376
Are you kidding me?

114
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,337
She's right. Overruled!
Absolutely no crimes!

115
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,133
You know that sort of thing
is wrong, so stop sulking.

116
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:28,680
Everyone, please suggest
ideas we can actually do.

117
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,849
Hey! It's my turn!

118
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,643
Go, Second-year
Izayoi Nonomi.

119
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,605
No more crimes or scams please.

120
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,023
Of course!

121
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,692
It's neither a crime nor a scam,

122
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,820
but legal, wholesome, and helpful!

123
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,364
Nonomi!

124
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,199
How about we become...

125
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,659
...idols!

126
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,536
High school idols!

127
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,372
-Idols?
-That's right.

128
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,417
Being idols is a surefire way
to revive the school.

129
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,256
Once we make our big debut...

130
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,674
Overruled!

131
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,845
Why not? I already came up
with our ending pose.

132
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,431
Did any of you actually
think about this?

133
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,643
Keep this up, and you
can forget about this meeting!

134
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,603
Hold on, Ayane.

135
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,689
How about we let Sensei chip in?

136
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,316
Huh? Me?

137
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,318
Yeah, Sensei.

138
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,863
Which of today's ideas did you like?

139
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,199
W-Which one?

140
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,743
Naturally, the bank robbery.

141
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,079
No, it was the bus hijacking.

142
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,498
Idols please!

143
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,460
-M-Maybe the idols...
-You all...

144
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,714
Enough is...

145
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,883
...enough!

146
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,304
We made Ayane mad.

147
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,941
Target acquired.

148
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:03,692
Hm.

149
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,987
Aru, did we really
have to go so far

150
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,072
over a simple retrieval job?

151
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,491
Call me Boss when
we're working,

152
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,992
Chief Mutsuki.

153
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,997
Sometimes you have to crack
eggs to make an omelette.

154
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,500
Don't fret over
every minor detail.

155
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,712
That's what real outlaws do.

156
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,173
Aru's being a weirdo again.

157
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,551
Uh, Boss...

158
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,803
Wh-What's wrong,
Department Head Kayoko?

159
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:36,808
The client wanted the target
brought back unharmed, right?

160
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,811
Of course. Is there a problem?

161
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,027
Wh-What?

162
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,654
Boss, are we...

163
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,240
No pay for us.

164
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,579
Wh-Wh-What?

165
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,541
What did you say?!

166
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,255
We said sorry, Ayane.

167
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,508
The ramen's on us.
So don't be angry.

168
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,051
I'm not angry.

169
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,637
Let me get that for you.

170
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,015
Don't treat me like a child.

171
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,393
-Have some more meat, Ayane.
-Fine.

172
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,353
Welcome!

173
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,355
How many are in your group?

174
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,107
Pardon.

175
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,361
What is the cheapest item on your menu?

176
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,199
That'd be our Shiba Seki Ramen at 580 yen.

177
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,409
It's our delicious
house special.

178
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,703
Thank you!

179
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,210
Aru, the special here
costs 580 yen.

180
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,879
Finally, some food
under 600 yen.

181
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,799
See, everything worked out fine.

182
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,509
Just as planned.

183
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,930
Welcome! Table for four?

184
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,932
Right this way.

185
00:09:59,015 --> 00:09:59,933
Oh, no.

186
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,895
We're only ordering one bowl,
so take out is fine.

187
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,981
But you're already here.
Please have a seat and eat.

188
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,566
We have plenty of room.

189
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,443
What friendly staff.

190
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,363
You know what? Why not.

191
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh, waiter.
Four pairs of chopsticks, please.

192
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,410
Eh? Wait a minute...

193
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,830
Are you four
sharing a single bowl?

194
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,456
S-Sorry.

195
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,125
We're all flat broke.

196
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,127
It's okay, you don't
have to apologize.

197
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,506
You don't understand.
No money means no life.

198
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,216
We don't deserve to live.

199
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,802
We are less than insects.

200
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,263
Sorry for being penniless insects.

201
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,098
Haruka, people are staring.

202
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,057
What are you saying?

203
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,394
Being broke is not a sin.

204
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,437
Right, Master?

205
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,524
Sure thing.
Money comes and goes.

206
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,526
You girls are students, right?

207
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,819
Y-Yes.

208
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,322
But you pooled your money
just to have my Ramen.

209
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,032
That warms my heart.

210
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,409
I'll get cooking.

211
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,994
Please take a seat while you wait.

212
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:01,870
Y-Yes.

213
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,248
I think they're overdoing it a bit.

214
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,167
Yeah, we're not
always this broke, right?

215
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,296
It's only because Aru
is terrible with money.

216
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,757
We didn't make a dime
from our last gig.

217
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,761
Then we had to drain our savings
hiring muscle for the next one.

218
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,515
And yet here we are about to
enjoy delicious Ramen, right?

219
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,517
Just as planned.

220
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:25,768
But Boss...

221
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,564
...is our next target strong enough
that we need that many people?

222
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,982
That's...

223
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,068
I'm convinced Aru
doesn't even know herself.

224
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,654
So she hired a whole
squadron out of fear.

225
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,573
Who says I'm scared?

226
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,450
Failure is not an option.

227
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,077
Expect the unexpected!

228
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,039
You all know that's
Problem Solver 68's motto.

229
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,249
I don't remember us
having that motto.

230
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,376
That's because
she just came up with it.

231
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,794
Shut up!

232
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,630
Thank you for waiting.

233
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,674
Wh-What is this?

234
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,718
What a huge bowl!

235
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,553
Looks like enough
for ten people.

236
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,056
Is this the right order?

237
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,726
We can't afford
something like this.

238
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,937
Nope, this is all yours.

239
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,606
A Shiba Seki Ramen for 580 yen.

240
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,274
Right, Master?

241
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,234
I measured out
the ingredients wrong...

242
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,528
...so you girls can
eat the extras.

243
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,533
I didn't expect this...

244
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,703
...but if he worked so hard,
we can't waste it, can we?

245
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,747
Let's eat, Aru!

246
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,123
Of course!

247
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,709
Thank you for the food!

248
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,720
So good!

249
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,682
Isn't it?

250
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,017
The Ramen here's the best.

251
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,560
It really is.

252
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,647
I've eaten at a lot of
different restaurants.

253
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,276
But Ramen this
delicious is a rarity.

254
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,861
Is that uniform from Gehenna Academy?

255
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,613
You came a long way to eat.

256
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,115
Y-Yes.

257
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,326
We're all regulars here.

258
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,452
Is that so?

259
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,621
-I envy you.
-Kayoko.

260
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,124
-Aren't they...
-Mmm.

261
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,584
They're Abydos students.

262
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,965
It's so nice to meet people
that I click with.

263
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,926
Unexpected encounters
like this...

264
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,304
...are what make
life interesting.

265
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,431
Agreed.

266
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,019
Aru still doesn't realize it?

267
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,478
Should we tell her?

268
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,356
No, it's funnier this way.

269
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,651
Well, take care.

270
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,362
(Shiba Seki Ramen)
Good luck making money out there.

271
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:41,446
(Shiba Seki Ramen)

272
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,157
(Shiba Seki Ramen)
Same to you as well.

273
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,284
I'll be rooting for you.

274
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,036
See ya!

275
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,085
Weren't they nice?

276
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,714
Uh, Boss...

277
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,050
Yes, Department Head Kayoko?

278
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,802
Did you get a good look at their uniforms?

279
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,597
Uniforms? What about them?

280
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,101
They're students from Abydos High School.

281
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,271
Wh-What?

282
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,648
What did you say?!

283
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,860
The look on your face.

284
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,447
That means they're our next target?

285
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,449
Should I pursue them?

286
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,867
No, they're gone already.

287
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,536
I figure we'll take
them on soon enough.

288
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,997
You can cut loose then, Haruka.

289
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,290
R-right.

290
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,292
N-No way!

291
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,795
I can't believe they
were our next target.

292
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,505
Don't sweat it.

293
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,840
"We'll do the crime
if you've got the dime."

294
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,592
That's our motto, right?

295
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,677
So what's the problem?

296
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,222
You're right, but...

297
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,475
The Boss is a giant softy.
This is gonna be a pain.

298
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,355
Now that won't do, Aru.

299
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,149
You're the boss that charts our course.

300
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,652
Let's go!

301
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,492
Eh? Is that what you all
got up to yesterday?

302
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,538
Yep! We became friends with some
students from Gehenna.

303
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,416
They were really wowed
by the master's Ramen.

304
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,291
Right?

305
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,169
The master's Ramen really is the best.

306
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,422
What were they like?

307
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,841
Apparently they run some
kind of business—

308
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,425
(Urgent Warning Intruders detected.)
Apparently they run some Kind of business—

309
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:25,800
(Urgent Warning
Intruders detected.)

310
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:33,307
The monitors south of the school
detect an armed force approaching.

311
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,268
Is it the Helmet Gang again?

312
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,394
No.

313
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,895
Looks like...

314
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,440
a mercenary company.

315
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,525
Are you ready?

316
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,651
Of course.

317
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,112
We'll fight whoever,
just no overtime.

318
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,030
Especially at your pay.

319
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,907
Quiet about that!

320
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,119
Now then, let's go attack
Abydos High School.

321
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,871
Roger.

322
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,874
Weren't they at Shiba Seki Ramen?

323
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,000
Nonomi?

324
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,129
Sensei, those are the Gehenna students
we mentioned earlier.

325
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,506
You traitors!

326
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,134
To think we even gave you
an extra large Ramen!

327
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,427
Ingrates!

328
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,889
Thanks a bunch yesterday.

329
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,183
But that was then.
This is now.

330
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,018
You know we're broke right?

331
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,229
We don't mix business with pleasure.

332
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,690
We were paid for this job,
so we have to work.

333
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,443
Indeed, it's just who we are.

334
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,945
Problem Solver 68!

335
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,074
I see. So you lot are hired guns.

336
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,662
You're students! You should have
more wholesome part-time jobs!

337
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,498
This isn't just some part-time job,

338
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,374
it's a serious business!

339
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,293
We even have proper titles, too.

340
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,087
I'm the Boss.

341
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,881
She's the Chief,

342
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,549
and this is our Department Head.

343
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,303
You're making us look silly.

344
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,430
Who hired you?

345
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,432
That's a trade secret.

346
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,560
Guess we'll have to make you talk.

347
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,979
We're just following orders.

348
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,273
Don't take it so personally.

349
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,234
Everyone, let's go!

350
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,068
Right.

351
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,904
-Let's make this quick.
-Sure.

352
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,116
Stop resisting and just
hand over the school.

353
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,410
We'll never do that.

354
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,581
Now, Kayoko!

355
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,500
Nice, Mutsuki.

356
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,005
Drop your weapon.

357
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,516
Serika!

358
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,518
Don't worry, I'm fine.

359
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,523
I have you now.

360
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,233
Geez.

361
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,945
<i>Ca.</i>

362
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,202
Claymore.

363
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,873
Shiroko?!

364
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm all right.

365
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,671
That was close.

366
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,509
We're cornered.

367
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,480
Take this!

368
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,694
They're no pushovers.

369
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,991
Even if we can match their strength,

370
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,576
we can't match their numbers.

371
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,036
In that case...

372
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,245
Everyone,

373
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,205
I have a plan.

374
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,373
Listen closely.

375
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,417
Sensei.

376
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,961
Shiroko, there's something
I need you to do.

377
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,009
They still haven't surrendered?

378
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,220
Keep shooting until they do!

379
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,975
Here we go.

380
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,770
-Wh-What?
-Why are they so fired up?

381
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,104
That hurt!

382
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,941
We're not just gonna sit and take it.

383
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,818
Just give up.

384
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:16,989
Aru.

385
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,624
Haruka.

386
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,417
What's with the change in tactics?

387
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,173
Could it be...

388
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,133
Boss, watch out!

389
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,218
For what?!

390
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,054
Oh no.

391
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,020
—Boss!
—Aru!

392
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,023
We are Problem Solver 68!

393
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,943
We always get the job done.

394
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,487
Give up
and hand over your school.

395
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,615
No way.

396
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,182
Quitting time.

397
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,309
And we said no overtime.

398
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,813
That's our shift.

399
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:31,856
Yep.

400
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,858
N-Now wait a minute!

401
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,359
We're so close!

402
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,820
You said no overtime pay.

403
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,531
You guys handle it.

404
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,324
I'm beat.

405
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,035
-Wanna get some burgers?
-Sounds good.

406
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,412
Can I come too?

407
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:50,166
Seems mercenaries
never work for free.

408
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,585
They all left.

409
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,170
Guess we just lost.

410
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,005
We're in trouble now.

411
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,132
Think we should bail, Aru?

412
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,553
This battle isn't over.

413
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,349
Aru, you sound like
a B-movie supervillain.

414
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,018
Shut up. Run!

415
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,395
I mean, retreat!

416
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,482
Wait up, Aru!

417
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,858
Later!

418
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,071
What interesting girls.

419
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,407
What even was that?

420
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,742
Who knows...

421
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,870
I'm starving.

422
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,080
Now that everything's settled,

423
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,333
wanna grab something to eat?

424
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,793
-I'm in.
-Yep!

425
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,045
Will you treat us, Sensei?

426
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,006
H-Hold on! Let me
make sure I have the money!

427
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,091
Thanks a bunch!

428
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:04,448
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

429
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:10,204
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

430
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,835
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

431
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,837
With all those laughs we shared⋯

432
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:25,177
Even if⋯those moments were just ordinary

433
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,012
Those days⋯

434
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,516
One more time, one time more,

435
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,019
Knowing they won't come around again!

436
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:37,565
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

437
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,193
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

438
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,822
Would that let me finally forgive

439
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,325
All those regrets we made so willfully?

440
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,704
We only recognize the important things

441
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,833
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

442
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,378
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

443
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,757
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

444
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:08,929
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days⋯

445
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:18,981
(Kaiser PMC Director
Rikuhachima Aru, Problem Solver 68)

446
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,482
(Kaiser PMC Director Rikuhachima
Aru, Problem Solver 68) What trash...

447
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,401
It seems those Abydos girls are

448
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,654
more persistent
than our data suggests.

449
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,992
But data is always changing.

450
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,453
Don't worry.

451
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,914
I'll root out
this little error.
