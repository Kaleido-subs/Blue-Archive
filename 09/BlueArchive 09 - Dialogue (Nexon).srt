1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:01,460
Hey

2
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,754
Hey, listen to me!

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,924
- Hoshino
- What is it?

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,052
Ta-da! Look at this

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,595
An Oasis Festival?

6
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:16,767
Yes! Back then, the oasis
was as big as a lake

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,019
Here, Keep this as a souvenir

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,606
Isn't it amazing?

9
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,525
It would take a miracle,
but it would be great

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,569
if people gathered here
like old times—

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,155
That'll never happen

12
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,073
Why not?

13
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,533
Because miracles don't happen

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,203
Be realistic

15
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:41,458
Why would anyone
come to this wasteland?

16
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,086
You can't keep daydreaming

17
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,838
But⋯

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,715
S-Sorry

19
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,844
You're too preoccupied with
miracles and nonsense⋯

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,973
You're the Abydos Student Council president!

21
00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:00,185
Focus on your responsibilities!

22
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:06,316
The sky blue archive!

23
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,121
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

24
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:23,333
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,671
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,508
Those clouds like whales are always changing

27
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,554
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

28
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,934
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

29
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,188
If I were here alone, here without all of you

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,234
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

31
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,278
A fateful coterie

32
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:59,202
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

33
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:08,170
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

34
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:13,925
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

35
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:25,020
Because this is the only place where we belong

36
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,533
Good morning, Shiroko

37
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,161
Hoshino

38
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,918
Can we talk for a sec?

39
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,631
About yesterday⋯

40
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,925
-I'm sorry
- No

41
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,676
What I said was unfair

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,055
Only because you were
worried about me⋯ Right?

43
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,516
Of course, I was

44
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,895
The Abydos Foreclosure Task
Force includes all five of us

45
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,232
I'm glad to hear you say that

46
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,984
Now⋯ Hoshino

47
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,863
I don't know what you're hiding

48
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,491
But I trust you

49
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,748
You're such a great friend

50
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,460
Everyone!

51
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,546
As you may have heard,

52
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,174
a third party has taken control
of the Abydos District

53
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,885
I looked into it and
discovered something

54
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,469
(Real Estate Title)

55
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,264
(Real Estate Title)
The land Abydos occupies

56
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:42,723
The land Abydos occupies

57
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,433
is owned by Kaiser Construction

58
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,810
(Kaiser Construction Co, Ltd)
is owned by Kaiser Construction

59
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:46,977
(Kaiser Construction Co, Ltd)

60
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,603
But that means⋯

61
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,981
The Kaiser Corporation
is behind this after all

62
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,317
This building, the surrounding area,

63
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,612
the school's buried main building,

64
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,907
the wastelands around it,

65
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,660
even the land the city occupies⋯

66
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,163
It's all changed ownership

67
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,664
That far?

68
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,499
But how did they do it?

69
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,836
Not just anyone can
sell the District's land

70
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,588
It must have been the
Abydos Student Council

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,673
- Huh?
- That's correct

72
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,801
The Student Council sold the land

73
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,721
What were they thinking?!

74
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,641
How could they just hand over Abydos?!

75
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:31,146
They already own every
other school district

76
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,064
It's common knowledge

77
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,651
But we were so focused
on paying off our debts

78
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,571
that we didn't even notice

79
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,117
I'm sorry
I should have caught this sooner

80
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,162
Ayane, it's not your fault

81
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,332
It happened before we even enrolled

82
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,917
Hang on⋯

83
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,378
Hoshino, weren't you on
the Student Council?

84
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,214
Really?

85
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,259
Yeah, As the vice president

86
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,596
That's right

87
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,892
But it was just me and the president

88
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,685
What? Only two of you?

89
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,354
Mm-hmm

90
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,316
There were only a handful
of students left at the time

91
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:20,237
We had no staff
All the classes were canceled

92
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,823
The Student Council room
was nothing but storage

93
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,787
Our president was infamous
for being a reckless idiot

94
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,457
And I was pretty ruthless for a freshman

95
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,669
It was a disaster

96
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,380
What kind of Student Council was that?

97
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:43,552
We were just a couple of
fools with titles⋯

98
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,515
wandering aimlessly⋯

99
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,352
completely clueless

100
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,817
You shouldn't blame yourself

101
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,861
I don't know exactly what happened

102
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,157
But you're the reason the
Foreclosure Task Force exists

103
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,075
Huh?

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,244
Yes, you're lazy

105
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,621
And you're careless

106
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,415
And that's definitely a problem

107
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,918
But you always come
through when it counts

108
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,670
I respect you for that

109
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,964
Shiroko, what is this?

110
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,842
You're talking like we're in
some kind of teen drama!

112

(Kaiser Group, Kaiser Construction)

113
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:31,099
Why did the Student Council
sell to Kaiser Corporation?

114
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:36,271
Maybe they were trying
to pay off their debts?

115
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,442
I'm just guessing

116
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,527
But, the school had a lot

117
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,615
of problems to solve

118
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,742
I agree

119
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,747
But Abydos is half-buried in sand
It wouldn't have been worth much

(Loan Agreement, Proof of Transfer

121
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:59,002
(Loan Agreement, Proof of Transfer Real Estate Sales Contract)
Maybe enough to cover the interest, but not the principal

122
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:03,340
It was a vicious cycle
They had to keep selling land⋯

123
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,758
Do you think that's what happened?

124
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,009
What a mess!

125
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,970
It's been a lost cause from the start

126
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,931
It was a scam

127
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:11,765
Huh?

128
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,223
(Kaiser Construction (Kaiser Group) / Loan - Abydos High

129
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,434
(Kaiser Construction (Kaiser Group) / Loan - Abydos High School - Unable to Repay
Land and Buildings, Interest) They lend more money than the school can ever repay

130
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,185
(Kaiser Construction (Kaiser Group) / Loan - Abydos High

131
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,437
(Kaiser Construction (Kaiser Group) / Loan - Abydos High School - Unable to
Repay Land and Buildings, Interest) Then they demand at least the interest

132
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,190
And when the school can't pay,
they're forced to sell property

133
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,317
Yes, that must be it

134
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,111
Given enough time, Kaiser Corporation

135
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,281
could take the entire Abydos
District piece by piece

136
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,407
That sounds plausible

137
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,328
Maybe they planned it from the start

138
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,082
Yes, from the moment they
loaned money to Abydos

139
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,044
They must've set this trap ages ago

140
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,214
Decades, even⋯

141
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,592
So we've been playing into
their hands all along?

142
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,053
To think we fell for such a scam!

143
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,680
Calm down, Serika

144
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,891
The fault lies with the deceiver,
not their victim

145
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,519
I know

146
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,104
But still⋯

147
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,068
People get desperate when
they feel cornered

148
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,489
They'll try anything, even if it
makes things worse

149
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,659
That's just how it goes, Serika

150
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,954
The school's debt,

151
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,456
Abydos' predicament,

152
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,544
and this new information⋯

153
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,131
Little by little, it's all becoming clear

154
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,009
Once the Abydos Student Council folded,

155
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,678
they couldn't buy the land anymore

156
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,347
So they hired the Helmet Gang

157
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,851
to take the school and
the remaining land

158
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,647
But if that's true, then it was
never about the money

159
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:46,443
Kaiser Corporation was only
interested in the land

160
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,320
You may be right

161
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,490
But that raises another question

162
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,119
Why would anyone want
this barren wasteland?

163
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,579
That's a good point

164
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,373
In its present state,

165
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,001
Abydos isn't very profitable

166
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,879
Listen⋯

167
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,091
It's about the desert
After the fight with Gehenna⋯

168
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,677
Kaiser Corporation has
been up to something

169
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:17,348
in the desert of Abydos

170
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,559
Really?

171
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,103
Why would Gehenna's Head
Prefect say such a thing?

172
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,564
Sensei, why didn't you tell us this before?

173
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,567
Ah! I-I had a lot on my plate!

174
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,153
And I had no idea what to do

175
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,364
You should have told us anyway!

176
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,325
I'm sorry

177
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,578
Kaiser Corporation bought the land

178
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,789
And they're up to something⋯

179
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,874
Serika's right

180
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,377
The truth lies in the Abydos Desert

181
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,337
Yeah

182
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,798
- Right
- Yes

183
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,801
Okay, then, Let's go

184
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,511
To the Abydos Desert!

185
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,769
From here on, we'll have to walk

186
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,522
If anyone passes out,
we'll have problems

187
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,775
Leave it to us!

188
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,986
I'm really sorry, everyone

189
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,782
I haven't seen this view in a while⋯

190
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,867
You've been here before?

191
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,495
A few times, yes, for
Student Council work

192
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,958
A bit further
The oasis is just ahead!

193
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,751
What? An oasis?

194
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:31,422
Yes, but it's dried up now

195
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,677
This is where they held the
Abydos Oasis Festival

196
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,055
- Oasis Festival?
- I've heard of that!

197
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,391
It was well known in Abydos

198
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,935
Tons of people attended

199
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:44,894
Exactly

200
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,608
It was so popular that it drew
people from other districts

201
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,945
To the middle of a desert?

202
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:58,741
I heard it was a nice place to live once

203
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,915
Hey, Hoshino! Look!

204
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,333
Look over there!

205
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,962
- Can we really trust this?
- Yeah

206
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:12,755
(Drawn by Yume / Desert / Here / School)

207
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,923
(Drawn by Yume / Desert / Here / School)
That's definitely the oasis

208
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:14,215
That's definitely the oasis

209
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,176
where they held the festival

210
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,734
There's a huge facility up ahead

211
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,736
In a place like this?

212
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,364
Maybe that's what
Hina was talking about

213
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,909
Listen, everyone
We don't know what's there

214
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,578
So be very careful while
you investigate

215
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,913
- Got it
- Okay

216
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,252
Look at all those guards

217
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,963
What is this place?

218
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,840
Kaiser PMC.

219
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,550
It's another

220
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,054
subsidiary of Kaiser Corporation

221
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,723
- PMC.
- You know it?

222
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,976
Yes, it's short for
Private Military Company

223
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,938
It's a civilian military operation

224
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,066
They're a step above
the Helmet Gang

225
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,568
Professionals

226
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,779
Are those⋯

227
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,785
- Intruders!
- Capture them!

228
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,827
- Surround them
- To the right!

229
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,290
Darn

230
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,376
There are too many of them

231
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,878
It's worse than handling
the Prefect Team

232
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,339
What should we do, Hoshino?

233
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,635
Don't be reckless! Retreat!

234
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:59,654
Well, well⋯
I heard there were intruders

235
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,116
I didn't realize they were
Abydos students

236
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,617
That looks like⋯

237
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,369
No way!

238
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,037
Huh?

239
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,666
You're the Student Council
president Gematria was after

240
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,585
No⋯the vice president

241
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,338
Who are you?

242
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,217
You don't know who I am?

243
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,678
I am⋯

244
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,140
the Kaiser Corporation Director

245
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,560
I knew it

246
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,645
He's the one⋯

247
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:37,108
He tricked the Abydos Student
Council out of their land

248
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,739
Choose your words carefully

249
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,657
After all, you're trespassing on

250
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,661
Kaiser PMC property

251
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,957
You do know that's a crime

252
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,335
But to your point⋯

253
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,047
the Abydos District

254
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,883
Yes, we bought it

255
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,510
It was entirely legal

256
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,347
We have the records to prove it

257
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:12,685
But why buy land
in the middle of a desert?

258
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,396
I'll tell you why

259
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,442
We're looking for buried treasure

260
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,153
It's somewhere here in Abydos

261
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,197
You're lying!

262
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,783
We're not falling for
that nonsense!

263
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,077
And it doesn't explain
all these soldiers

264
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,122
They're here to take
the school by force,

265
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,123
aren't they?

266
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,918
Preposterous

267
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:41,881
They're here to ensure no one
interferes with our search

268
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,134
We couldn't care less about you

269
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,764
You're nothing but pests,
easily crushed

270
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,182
Observe

271
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,937
It's me

272
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,272
What? Who is he calling?

273
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,359
Proceed

274
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,696
You're about to get some bad news

275
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,574
What is he doing?

276
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:10,785
(Kaiser Loans Abydos High School's credit rating has dropped to the lowest tier, Consequently, the variable interest
rate has increased to 3,000%, As such, next month's interest will total 91.3 million yen, Please ensure timely payment)

277
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,620
(Kaiser Loans Abydos High School's credit rating has dropped to the lowest tier, Consequently, the variable interest rate
has increased to 3,000%, As such, next month's interest will total 91.3 million yen, Please ensure timely payment) Wh-What?!

278
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:17,041
Our interest rate just went up—
3,000% starting next month!

279
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,459
What?

280
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,130
Now do you understand

281
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,467
who's holding the noose

282
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,928
around your necks?

283
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,388
This is cruel

284
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,057
How can we possibly pay that?

285
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,436
You're right, You should
probably give up now

286
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,856
Transfer to another school

287
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,943
This debt is the school's problem

288
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,531
Why take that burden on yourselves?

289
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,909
No, We can't give up

290
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,787
We won't abandon our school

291
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,249
Abydos is our school and our home

292
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,378
What exactly are you
going to do about it?

293
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,921
W-Well⋯

294
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,508
We have to go back

295
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,927
Hoshino

296
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,014
There's no point arguing

297
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,600
They'll only mock us

298
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,437
Spoken like a true
vice president

299
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,480
You're quite smart

300
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,442
Ah, I remember now⋯

301
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,445
You were the brains

302
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:31,532
Forced to serve at that
idiotic president's side

303
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,512
The new terms for your
loan take effect next month

304
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,056
Thank you for your cooperation,

305
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,599
valued customers

306
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,819
Who do they think they are?!

307
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,198
They say they're looking for treasure

308
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,324
But there's nothing left

309
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:18,079
in that desert, oil or otherwise

310
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,958
We surveyed it ages ago

311
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,876
Shiroko?

312
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,545
I'm going back

313
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,172
I'll find out what they're really up to

314
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,508
You're going back to the desert?

315
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,762
With enough preparation,
we can infiltrate their base

316
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,305
W-Wait a minute!

317
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,433
Paying off our debt is more—

318
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,062
There's no way we can pay,
not legally anyway

319
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,147
Shiroko, you can't go!

320
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,650
No, Shiroko is right

321
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,695
If we lose the school, it's over

322
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,530
This is no time for scruples!

323
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,448
Think logically, Serika

324
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,326
It's just like when we raided
that Black Market Bank

325
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,912
If we use stolen funds
to save Abydos,

326
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,873
could we ever
hold our heads high?

327
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:03,791
But—

328
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,668
I understand your frustration

329
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,254
But I won't let you
become criminals

330
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,423
Then what are we supposed to do?

331
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,091
Well⋯

332
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,804
Okay, everyone, calm down

333
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,390
Emotions are running
pretty hot right now

334
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,183
Aren't they, Shiroko?

335
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,770
Sorry, That wasn't my intention

336
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,273
Yeah, we know

337
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,818
Why don't we call it
a day for now?

338
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,822
Go home, Cool off
We'll regroup tomorrow

339
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,366
President's orders

340
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,036
- Okay
- You're right

341
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,412
Y-Yes

342
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,291
All right

343
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,378
Good, See you tomorrow, everyone

344
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,567
⋯too preoccupied with

345
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,403
miracles and nonsense⋯

346
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,321
Right?

347
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,700
- Hoshino
-Hm?

348
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,036
Oh, Sensei, It's just you

349
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,330
Just me? What's that
supposed to mean?

350
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,539
Oh, Right

351
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:28,042
Hey, since when can you talk

352
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,295
to Shiroko with just a look?

353
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,965
I really can't let my guard
down around you, Sensei

354
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,763
Hoshino, can I ask you something?

355
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,015
Sure, what is it?

356
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,725
(Withdrawal Form)

357
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,935
(Withdrawal Form)
Oh, that

358
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:46,727
(Withdrawal Form)

359
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,145
(Withdrawal Form)
Can you explain?

360
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,566
I suppose so

361
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,277
But it's a bit awkward
to talk face-to-face

362
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,198
Would you walk with me?

363
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,785
Sensei⋯

364
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,747
Isn't it sad that my high school life

365
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,041
is the color of this sand?

366
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,254
I thought you loved
this place, Hoshino

367
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,675
They say Abydos was a powerful school

368
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:22,388
before the desert took it

369
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,516
But I don't have

370
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,893
any memory of it

371
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,855
The school was a
mess from day one

372
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,150
They didn't do anything right

373
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,488
But it's your one and only Alma mater

374
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,826
Abydos' main building was buried

375
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,620
long before this old-timer enrolled

376
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,873
This is just an annex

377
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:54,044
We relocated several times
before we settled here

378
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,842
Still, this is where I met the
Foreclosure Task Force⋯

379
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,430
So I suppose I do like it after all

380
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:10,978
Sensei

381
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,689
I feel⋯

382
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,361
relieved

383
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:24,074
If the youngins hear
about this, they'll worry

384
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,994
But I shouldn't keep secrets

385
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,997
from them either

386
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,542
I'll explain everything
to them tomorrow

387
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,462
The truth may upset them⋯

388
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,423
No, I'm glad you told me

389
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,885
I'm sure they'll understand too

390
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,387
It'll be all right
We have a lot of problems

391
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,432
But we'll figure them out together

392
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,268
Yeah

393
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,271
It might take a miracle

394
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,065
Together, we can make a miracle

395
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,191
I'm sure of it

396
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,405
All right, well, enough of this chit chat!

397
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,741
Bye, Sensei

398
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:06,826
Yes

399
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,119
See you tomorrow

400
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:31,475
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

401
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,231
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

402
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,862
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

403
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,864
With all those laughs we shared⋯

404
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:52,204
Even if⋯those moments were just ordinary

405
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,039
Those days⋯

406
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,585
One more time, one time more,

407
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,046
Knowing they won't come around again!

408
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,592
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

409
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:08,262
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

410
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,849
Would that let me finally forgive

411
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,352
All those regrets we made so willfully?

412
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,647
We only recognize the important things

413
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,860
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

414
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:26,447
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

415
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,784
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

416
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:35,998
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days⋯
