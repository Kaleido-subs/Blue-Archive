Dialogue: 10,0:05:39.72,0:05:44.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it was just a couple of idiots \Ndoing stupid things together at the end of the day.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:45.02,0:05:49.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Man, we really were just loitering \Naround all sorts of places back then.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:49.52,0:05:52.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Just a few idiots, blissfully unaware of anything.
Dialogue: 10,0:05:56.52,0:05:59.32,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not something you should blame yourself for.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:00.40,0:06:02.36,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't know what happened in the past.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:02.72,0:06:06.84,Default,,0,0,0,,But what I do know is that without you, \Nthe Task Force wouldn't be here today.

Dialogue: 10,0:06:10.06,0:06:12.18,Default,,0,0,0,,You never give a straight answer.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:12.40,0:06:14.06,Default,,0,0,0,,And you've got lots of other problems.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:14.18,0:06:17.38,Default,,0,0,0,,But you're always the first to step up when we need you.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:17.70,0:06:19.10,Default,,0,0,0,,And I respect you.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:19.94,0:06:21.78,Default,,0,0,0,,Where's this coming from, Shiroko?
Dialogue: 10,0:06:21.88,0:06:24.54,Default,,0,0,0,,You can't just drop a line like that out of nowhere!
Dialogue: 10,0:06:26.16,0:06:31.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Speaking of which, why did the student council sell \Nthe land to Kaiser Corporation in the first place?
Dialogue: 10,0:06:31.88,0:06:36.68,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm guessing they were just \Ntrying to pay off the debt at first.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:37.78,0:06:40.94,Default,,0,0,0,,I wasn't involved in it, though, so this is just speculation.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:41.98,0:06:47.04,Default,,0,0,0,,But I think they were trying their best for the sake \Nof the school, and more things just kept happening.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:47.62,0:06:49.30,Default,,0,0,0,,I think so, too.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:49.92,0:06:54.72,Default,,0,0,0,,But there's no way all the land covered by desert \Nwould have been worth very much.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:55.08,0:06:59.46,Default,,0,0,0,,They may have paid back the interest, \Nbut they couldn't have reduced the principle.
Dialogue: 10,0:06:59.72,0:07:03.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So then they would have been trapped \Nin a vicious cycle of selling more land.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:04.18,0:07:05.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Is that correct?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:05.56,0:07:06.82,Default,,0,0,0,,What the heck!
Dialogue: 10,0:07:06.96,0:07:09.68,Default,,0,0,0,,That means the game was rigged from the start!
Dialogue: 10,0:07:09.78,0:07:11.60,Default,,0,0,0,,You might be right about that.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:11.72,0:07:12.72,Default,,0,0,0,,What?
Dialogue: 10,0:07:12.84,0:07:15.42,Default,,0,0,0,,First, they make a loan that could never be paid off.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:15.86,0:07:20.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Then, they pressure the school to sell their land \Nin order to pay even a portion of the debt.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:21.56,0:07:22.88,Default,,0,0,0,,That has to be it.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:23.22,0:07:28.96,Default,,0,0,0,,And so the entire Abydos school district slowly falls \Ninto the hands of the Kaiser Corporation.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:29.08,0:07:33.84,Default,,0,0,0,,True. They may have planned for this all along.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:34.04,0:07:37.56,Default,,0,0,0,,That was why they lent Abydos \Nthe money in the first place.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:38.30,0:07:41.48,Default,,0,0,0,,The trap may have been set \N far earlier than we realized.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:42.50,0:07:44.70,Default,,0,0,0,,Decades ago, even.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:44.92,0:07:48.24,Default,,0,0,0,,What? That means Kaiser just \Nplayed them like a damn fiddle!
Dialogue: 10,0:07:48.34,0:07:50.78,Default,,0,0,0,,I can't believe they fell for this scam...
Dialogue: 10,0:07:50.86,0:07:52.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Calm down, Serika.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:52.66,0:07:55.66,Default,,0,0,0,,I think the perpetrators are \Nto blame here, not the victims.
Dialogue: 10,0:07:55.74,0:07:58.44,Default,,0,0,0,,I know that!
Dialogue: 10,0:07:58.66,0:07:59.68,Default,,0,0,0,,But still...
Dialogue: 10,0:08:02.38,0:08:05.64,Default,,0,0,0,,People will do anything when \Nthey're driven into a corner.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:07.26,0:08:10.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Even if they know it'll only make things worse.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:10.82,0:08:13.14,Default,,0,0,0,,That's all that this is, Serika.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:15.00,0:08:16.36,Default,,0,0,0,,The school's debt...

Dialogue: 10,0:08:23.40,0:08:26.62,Default,,0,0,0,,I think all the pieces are starting to fall into place.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:27.02,0:08:32.28,Default,,0,0,0,,After the Abydos student council disappeared, \Nthey lost their ability to buy more land.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:32.48,0:08:38.34,Default,,0,0,0,,So in order to take over this final piece of land, \Nthey hired the Helmet Gang.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:39.14,0:08:43.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Does that mean Kaiser Corporation \Nwas never after the money?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:43.48,0:08:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Their true goal was the land itself all along?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:48.12,0:08:49.86,Default,,0,0,0,,It would make sense.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:50.36,0:08:52.96,Default,,0,0,0,,But then this raises another question.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:53.42,0:08:56.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Why would they want this land \Nwhen it's buried under the desert?
Dialogue: 10,0:08:57.00,0:08:58.28,Default,,0,0,0,,That's true.
Dialogue: 10,0:08:58.64,0:09:03.44,Default,,0,0,0,,What could they possibly stand to gain \Nfrom taking over Abydos as it is now?
Dialogue: 10,0:09:05.48,0:09:06.46,Default,,0,0,0,,Actually...
Dialogue: 10,0:09:07.58,0:09:10.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Speaking of the desert, right after we fought Gehenna,
