1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,503
Yes

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,713
As stated in the report,

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,924
we underestimated them

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,301
Yes

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,887
Within the week?!

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,473
N-No! We can do it
You can count on us

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,854
Boss, are we going after
the Abydos students again?

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,025
But with what money?
We used up all our funds

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,321
And paying rent on this office
takes up whatever we have left

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,822
Shut up!

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,325
Every decent company
needs an office space!

12
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,912
Personally, I liked our tent
in the park from before

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,706
I-I don't care where
as long as I'm with the boss

14
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,291
Shut up already!

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,502
I'll take out a loan

16
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,756
What?
But you're on every bank's blacklist

17
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,757
No, I'm not!

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,553
My accounts are just frozen
because I'm a wanted criminal!

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,555
Ah, right!

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,098
Just you watch

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,685
I won't let our
commission end like this!

22
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:04,398
The sky blue archive!

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,202
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

24
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:21,456
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

25
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,669
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

26
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,589
Those clouds like whales are always changing

27
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,635
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

28
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,016
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

29
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,270
If I were here alone, here without all of you

30
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,316
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

31
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,318
A fateful coterie

32
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:57,284
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

33
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:06,251
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

34
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:12,007
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

35
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:23,101
Because this is the only place where we belong

36
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,988
Thank you for doing business
with Kaiser Loans

37
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,825
Your total was 7,883,250 yen, in cash

38
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,827
Receipt confirmed

39
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,039
Then, until next month!

40
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,503
Safe for one more month⋯

41
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:55,092
But why does Kaiser Loans
only accept cash payments?

42
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,426
Good point

43
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,930
A bank transfer payment
would be faster and easier

44
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,517
Shiroko! You can't attack
that van, okay?

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,977
Yes, I know

46
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,479
So, let's start
the daily meeting now

47
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,898
(Foreclosure Task Force Daily Meeting)
So, let's start the daily meeting now

48
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,026
First, regarding the
part we found⋯

49
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,947
As expected, it was traded
on the Black Market

50
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:22,369
A lot of banned contraband
in Kivotos can be found there,

51
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:27,082
as well as clubs unauthorized
by the General Student Council,

52
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,542
so it's dangerous there

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,337
Problem Solver 68 seems
to frequent that market as well

54
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,381
Problem Solver 68

55
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,591
They're just like the Helmet Gangsters,

56
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,428
trying to take over our school

57
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:43,557
There must be something going on
for everyone to come after us like this

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,600
It's really concerning

59
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,979
Yes, investigating the connections
between these incidents

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,314
might be a good idea

61
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,608
Okay, It's settled then

62
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,236
Let's check it out!

63
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,491
Get the newest guns here!

64
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,869
- Really?
- Isn't it amazing?

65
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,455
So this is the Black Market

66
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,874
It's really packed

67
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,127
This place isn't controlled
by the General Student Council,

68
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,129
yet it's unbelievably massive

69
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,883
I know we hardly ever leave Abydos,

70
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,552
but outside our campus,
there's lots of weird places

71
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,138
Have you been here before?

72
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,057
No, it's my first time as well

73
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,270
But other schools have weird stuff too

74
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,522
I've heard of a giant water tank

75
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,274
called an aquarium

76
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,401
I'd like to see it one day

77
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,069
Sounds nice

78
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,158
Everyone, there's no telling
what could happen there

79
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,494
So please be careful

80
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,870
-Yes
- Okay

81
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,333
Stop right there!

82
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,960
Please stop chasing me!

83
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,214
- No can do
- We told you to come with us!

84
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,220
But I have nothing to say to you!

85
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,472
This uniform is⋯

86
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,015
from Trinity?

87
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,893
- I'll handle it
- Huh?

88
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,897
Are you okay?

89
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,565
Y-Yes

90
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,234
Who are you guys?

91
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,111
All we want is that girl

92
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,823
She's from Trinity General School,

93
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,116
the richest school in all of Kivotos

94
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,495
We're gonna kidnap her
and demand a hefty ransom

95
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,998
Kidnap first, negotiate later
It's a good way to make money

96
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,376
We can team up
if you're interested

97
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,837
We're willing to split the ransom money by—

98
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,050
Not interested

99
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,760
That was close

100
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,929
Thank you very much

101
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,432
My name is Ajitani Hifumi

102
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,935
Hifumi, you said? Nice to meet you

103
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,690
Anyway, what's a Trinity
student doing here?

104
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,817
Actually,

105
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,403
I'm looking for something

106
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,155
It's been discontinued,

107
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,200
but I heard they still
sell it here

108
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,869
Tanks?

109
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,579
Or illegal guns?

110
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,706
Or chemical weapons?

111
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,083
No, no!

112
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,002
It's⋯

113
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,504
Limited edition Peroro merch!

114
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,505
Peroro?

115
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,257
Yes, this one

116
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,886
This limited edition Peroro doll,
with only 100 ever made

117
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,639
It's from the Momo Friends series,
right?

118
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,766
I love them!

119
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,935
Isn't Peroro so cute?

120
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,562
You think so too?

121
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:36,646
Yes!

122
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,567
What are they talking about?
This old-timer doesn't get it

123
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,571
But why are you all here?

124
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,032
We're looking for something too

125
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,908
Something very hard to get,

126
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,286
but we heard it's sold here

127
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,413
I see

128
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,332
Same as me

129
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,419
You just came here to buy a doll,
but ended up in such a mishap

130
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,381
Well, I knew this was
a dangerous place

131
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,760
It's beyond the control
of the General Student Council,

132
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,263
so a lot of companies work
outside the law here

133
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,225
They even have their own
financial institutions and security forces

134
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,394
And all of these organizations

135
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,980
are illegal and
unauthorized, right?

136
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,026
That's why we should
avoid any security here

137
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,404
Hifumi, you sure know a lot

138
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,531
No, not that much

139
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,742
Okay! It's settled then

140
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,619
As a reward for saving you,

141
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,705
can you help us find
what we came here for?

142
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,833
H-HUH?!

143
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,297
Are we really going
to take out a loan from here?

144
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,801
This is the Black Market Bank, you know

145
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,845
Th-The interest rates must be crazy

146
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,975
Well, that is if Aru even
gets approved for a loan

147
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,353
Sh-Shut up!
Of course I'll get approved

148
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,105
Let's go in

149
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,859
About the parts
you're looking for,

150
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,862
(Taiyaki) there should be some
kind of trail, but it's so hard to follow

151
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,573
Like sales channels
or storage records⋯

152
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,827
It's as if someone's
deliberately hidden all of it

153
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,578
That's what it seems like, at least

154
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,539
Deliberately hidden it?

155
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,248
Yes

156
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,418
Even the companies
that dominate this market

157
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,795
don't normally do this

158
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,088
Is it that unusual?

159
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,550
It's more like,
"Why go to such lengths?"

160
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,679
Everyone here openly
engages in illegal activities,

161
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,181
so it's even weirder that
they're hiding things

162
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,475
Even that building over there

163
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,853
That's the Black Market Bank,

164
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,480
notorious even in this place

165
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,898
Black Market Bank?

166
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,400
According to rumors,

167
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:50,071
nearly 15% of crime-related
financial assets in Kivotos

168
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,323
flow through that bank

169
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,161
They get money from crimes

170
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,205
like embezzlement,
robbery, and kidnapping,

171
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,001
and then use it to buy
weapons for more crimes

172
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,503
And the vicious circle
continues endlessly

173
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:10,175
Which means that bank is
facilitating criminal activities

174
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,593
Exactly

175
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,929
Here, even the banks
are criminal organizations

176
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,683
That's⋯

177
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,352
the Black Market Guard!

178
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,313
Black Market Guard?

179
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,399
They're the best security
organization here in the market

180
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,234
They are escorting that van

181
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,403
A cash transport vehicle

182
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,618
Isn't that⋯?

183
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,788
The bank clerk who
collects our payments?

184
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,583
Thank you for waiting
Here is this month's collection

185
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,084
Well done

186
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,670
Sign here

187
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,588
Okay

188
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,054
Kaiser Loans is colluding
with the Black Market Bank

189
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,223
K-Kaiser Loans?

190
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,099
Hifumi, you know them?

191
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,226
Well⋯

192
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,479
That's the loan shark company
run by the notorious

193
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,481
Kaiser Corporation, right?

194
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,899
Are they a bad company?

195
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,401
Yes, the Kaiser Group may be

196
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,738
a diversified company,
but it walks a fine line between

197
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,323
legality and illegality

198
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,034
That doesn't sound good

199
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,246
Did you all take out
a loan from Kaiser?

200
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,249
It's a long story

201
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,418
Then, the reason
they only accept cash is

202
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,922
so they won't leave a paper trail?

203
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,092
I can't believe our money's been
going into the Black Market Bank

204
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:39,514
Which means we've been
funding criminal activities!

205
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,058
W-We can't be sure yet

206
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,309
There's no evidence

207
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,856
that Kaiser Loans has been
depositing our money there

208
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,486
You get a receipt whenever
you make a payment, right?

209
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,156
You'll have your evidence
if you find their receipt records

210
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,370
But all those documents
must be in their vaults already,

211
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,247
so we've hit a dead end

212
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,749
The Black Market Bank has

213
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,837
the strongest security system
in the Black Market

214
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,341
Hey, Hoshino

215
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,135
There's no other option

216
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,137
Huh? What option?

217
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,763
Oh, that one!

218
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,850
Right, that should
definitely work

219
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,019
By "that" you don't mean⋯

220
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,397
You're not talking about
what I'm thinking of, right?

221
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,650
U-Um, I don't understand

222
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,278
There's only one thing we can do

223
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,114
Rob the bank

224
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,741
Whaaat?

225
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,702
Shiroko, wait
There has to be another way!

226
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,164
Don't worry, We're only trying to
find evidence of their crimes

227
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,292
Is that really what this is?

228
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,919
Understood

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,504
You wouldn't listen
even if I tried to stop you

230
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,214
Well, but that's:⋯

231
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,466
Sorry, Hifumi

232
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,304
I should've thought ahead
and made you a mask too

233
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm going too?!

234
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,767
We're good people!
We couldn't just abandon you!

235
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,853
No, it's okay! I don't mind at all!

236
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,439
Hifumi, you can wear this

237
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,192
N-No, please wait

238
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,905
Yup, A perfect fit!

239
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,283
Does this mean

240
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,995
I really am going with you?

241
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,122
What are you talking about, Hifumi?

242
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,293
Didn't you promise
to help us out today?

243
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,296
How will I⋯

244
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:39,175
ever be able to face
the student council again?

245
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,262
It's fine!
We're not doing anything wrong

246
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,596
And you, Sensei?

247
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,932
I'm in too

248
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,268
If your money is being
used for criminal activities,

249
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,271
I can't accept that

250
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,230
- Hmm
- Yes

251
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,564
Well then,

252
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,316
Masked Swimsuit Gang,

253
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,403
let's go!

254
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,577
Sorry to keep you waiting

255
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,788
Yes, you should be

256
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,373
So am I approved?

257
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,917
We need this money ASAP.

258
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,838
I'm afraid you'll need
to look elsewhere

259
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,550
Wait just one second!
You won't give us a loan?!

260
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,011
- That's right
- Wait!

261
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,638
We even have an office
Why not?

262
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,056
You rent your office,

263
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,809
and your only
assets are firearms

264
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,478
We can't offer you
a loan with just this

265
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,897
If you had

266
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,818
bankable assets or good credit,
we could offer you a loan

267
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,072
So why don't you try
getting a part-time job?

268
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,657
Huh?!

269
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,285
Th-That really pisses me off

270
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,622
I ought to smash everything
and rob them blind!

271
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,708
No, I can't

272
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,752
The Black Market Guards are here

273
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,879
In the end, it really is hopeless

274
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,008
I don't have the guts to
pick a fight with the Black Market

275
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,386
What is this?
I'm so pathetic

276
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,556
I resolved to become
the greatest outlaw

277
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,850
in all of Kivotos

278
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,144
But now I'm being stymied

279
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,105
with trivial matters
like a loan approval

280
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,942
This isn't what I dreamed of

281
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,487
A hard-boiled outlaw

282
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,572
who fears nothing,

283
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,116
and isn't bound by anything--

284
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,494
That's who I wanted to be

285
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,718
Everyone drop your weapons
and get on the ground!

286
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,970
B-Bank robbers?

287
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,933
Do as you're told,
or I'll send you to hell!

288
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,267
Umm,

289
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,438
please get on the ground,
so you won't get hurt

290
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,025
We told you to drop your weapons

291
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,736
Um, everyone

292
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,115
Be careful not to hurt
any ordinary citizens

293
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,116
-Yes
- Okay

294
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,952
Now then, since everything's
going according to plan,

295
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,162
is it time for the next step?

296
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,624
Boss Faust, give us the command

297
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,086
Is Faust me?

298
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,170
Of course

299
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,966
Hifumi— No, Faust is our leader

300
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,635
You are the boss, And I am⋯

301
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,180
Christina!

302
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,016
Huh? Aren't they⋯

303
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,393
Abydos students?

304
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,562
Sh-Should we counterattack?

305
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,398
No, we don't seem
to be their targets

306
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,151
Everyone, don't even
think about resisting

307
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,531
- The delivery van that just came in⋯
- I understand

308
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,949
We'll give you everything!

309
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,618
Gold, cash, bonds!

310
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,372
No, all we want is
the collection records

311
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,001
O-Oh my, Who are they?

312
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,712
They have the guts to
rob the Black Market Bank!

313
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,840
What amazing skills
They're the ultimate professionals

314
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,634
C-Cool! I think I have a crush!

315
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,262
These are real outlaws!

316
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,055
Oh, I think I'm going to cry

317
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,518
H-Here you go
Please spare my life

318
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,272
Shiro— I mean, Blue 2
Did you get the goods?

319
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,524
Yes, but⋯

320
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,068
Okay, let's run

321
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,905
- Everyone, retreat
- Adios!

322
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,824
No one seems to be hurt, so⋯

323
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,451
Goodbye

324
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,081
C-Catch them!

325
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,958
Block the roads and
contact the Black Market Guards!

326
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,377
Nice villainy!

327
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,762
Well done on getting through
the blockades, everyone!

328
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,847
Yay! We made it!

329
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,934
Is it really okay for a
teacher to be doing this?

330
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,395
Shiroko, do you
have the records?

331
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,480
Here

332
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,693
What is all this?!

333
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,988
You just stole all
the money, Shiroko?!

334
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,033
No, Here are the
documents we wanted

335
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,369
This must be at least
a hundred million

336
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,038
Perfect! Let's take it all!

337
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,831
Serika, wait

338
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,084
What is it? With this, our debt⋯

339
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,503
We shouldn't do that, Serika

340
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,629
Why not?

341
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,467
We worked so hard
to earn this money,

342
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,637
and it just ended up
in that Black Market Bank!

343
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,139
She's right, And if we had
left this money there,

344
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,226
it could've been used by
criminals to buy more guns

345
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:44,146
Exactly! What's wrong with
stealing money from bad people?

346
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,108
I agree with Serika

347
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,277
This is dirty money,

348
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,196
so why can't we spend
it for a good cause?

349
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:56,617
And this amount of money
will really help with our debt!

350
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,078
Is that really okay with you?

351
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,209
Shiroko, what do you think?

352
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,128
Why're you asking me?

353
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,380
Hoshino will say no regardless

354
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,926
That's my Shiroko
You know me too well

355
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,762
We only need the documents,

356
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,888
not the money

357
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,017
If we justify stealing
from criminals now,

358
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,311
what about the next time?
And after that?

359
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,980
If this becomes a habit,

360
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,940
when we're in another tough spot,

361
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:32,486
we might become the criminals,
and say it was inevitable

362
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,655
As an old-timer,

363
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,241
I can't let you cute
youngins do that

364
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,828
If we end up resorting to this,

365
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,622
it'd have been better

366
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,624
to use Nonomi's glorious
gold card from the get-go

367
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,836
But Hoshino, you said no to⋯

368
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,963
I see

369
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,549
We need to pay off
our debt the right way,

370
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,427
or we won't be Abydos
High School anymore

371
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,137
Exactly

372
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,015
Then let's go back with
just the documents we need

373
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,266
What do you all say?

374
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,225
Yes!

375
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,020
I don't exactly know
your circumstances,

376
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,899
but money like this will
only bring you more trouble

377
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,818
It's like a cursed item

378
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,279
Wait just a moment!

379
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,038
D-Don't worry
I'm not your enemy

380
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,415
- Why is she here?
- Should we shoot her?

381
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,418
We can't shoot her
when she means no harm

382
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,836
Do you know her?

383
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,755
Yes, just a little

384
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,756
Well⋯

385
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,634
I saw you guys at the bank

386
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,513
Robbing and retreating
so efficiently⋯

387
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,182
It's rare to meet
such amazing outlaws

388
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,519
To be honest, I was totally shocked

389
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,106
I really admire how
bold you all were

390
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,982
I'll do my absolute best

391
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,859
to not be bound
by laws or rules,

392
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,195
and become a truly free spirit

393
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,364
That's the kind of outlaw I want to be!

394
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,824
What is she talking about?

395
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,741
Dunno

396
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,743
So if you don't mind,

397
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,414
can you tell me your name?

398
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,623
Name?

399
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,210
I mean the name
of your organization or team

400
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,089
I want to always remember
your wonderful deeds today

401
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,050
Okay, I understand what you're saying

402
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,760
N-Nonomi⋯!

403
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,887
People call us

404
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,099
the Masked Swimsuit Gang

405
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,977
The Masked Swimsuit Gang?

406
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,689
What a cool and chic name!

407
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,361
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth

408
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,196
Forsake mercy

409
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,158
and walk the path of chaos

410
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,577
That's our motto

411
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,122
C-Coool!

412
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,627
What are they doing?

413
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,006
That's enough, Let's go back

414
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,175
Adios, then!

415
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,343
We're riding off into the sunset!

416
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,346
The sun hasn't set yet

417
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,058
"Walk the path of chaos,"

418
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,811
I'll engrave those words on my soul!

419
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,730
I'll keep working hard!

420
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,816
When should we tell her?

421
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,319
It'll be funnier to tell her later

422
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,112
U-Um⋯

423
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,407
Did they leave that behind?

424
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,751
Does this mean we won't
have to skip meals anymore?

425
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,257
"Walk the path of chaos,"

426
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,676
Maybe I should write it down?

427
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,723
Aru's been talking nonstop
about the Masked Swimsuit Gang

428
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,643
When will she realize the truth?

429
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,648
Boss,
about that Masked Swimsuit Gang⋯

430
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,900
They're the Abydos students

431
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,860
Oh, is that so?

432
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,490
What did you say?!

433
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,784
Aru is totally shocked

434
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,662
N-No way!

435
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:31,433
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

436
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,189
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

437
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,820
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

438
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,823
With all those laughs we shared⋯

439
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:52,162
Even if⋯those moments were just ordinary

440
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,998
Those days⋯

441
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,501
One more time, one time more,

442
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,005
Knowing they won't come around again!

443
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,550
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

444
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,178
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

445
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,807
Would that let me finally forgive

446
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,311
All those regrets we made so willfully?

447
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,689
We only recognize the important things

448
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,818
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

449
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,405
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

450
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,743
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

451
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:35,914
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days⋯
