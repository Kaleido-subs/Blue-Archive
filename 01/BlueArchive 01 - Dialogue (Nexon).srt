00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,426
It was my choice,

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,888
and my fault...

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,141
This entire situation happened
because of me.

4
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:24,441
After witnessing
the results of the path I chose,

5
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,111
I finally realized that
you were right all along.

6
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,711
You explained it to me once,

7
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,713
what it meant to be a responsible person.

8
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,384
I couldn't understand your words back then,

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,469
but I do now.

10
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,514
It's not about what you've experienced,

11
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,057
but the choices you've made.

12
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,477
And there are choices only you can make.

14
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,609
I'll trust them. ..and you.

Please lead the way
down this twisted path

16
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,656
to a different end.

17
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,701
Someone must make the choices

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,661
that lead us to that future.

19
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,038
So, Sensei...

20
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,707
Please.

that overtook the city of Kivotos

30

Are you serious, Shiroko?

37
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,154
You rode from the Abydos industrial district
and back on a bicycle?!

38
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,364
That must be hundreds of kilometers!

39
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,701
I didn't check how far it was.

40
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,454
It was a pleasant ride though. Not too long.

41
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,040
Shiroko sure is something.

42
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,710

43
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,004
M-Mine?! I was just...

44
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,881
I did some reading at the library!

45
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,966
You were at the library this weekend, Serika?

46
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,178
I was there as well!

47

I-Is that so? I didn't see you!!

48
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,142
Anyways! What were you
reading about, Ayane?

49
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,479
I was researching a DOHC problem

50
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,815
I ran into during building repairs.

51
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,276
Ah! Let me explain what DOHC is.

52
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:40,197
The term is short for a type of engine
called a Dual Overhead Camshaft.

53
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,283
I thought it'd be
useful information to have.

What about you, Hoshino?

55
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,420
I did what any old-timer
does over the weekend.

56
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,838

60
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,557
I went shopping!

61
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,394
I bought some new snacks,

62

To start, we'll review current events.

66

Kivotos, the Academy City, is composed
of many different school districts.

67
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,003
The General Student Council,
led by the student council president,

68
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,340
maintains balance between the districts.

69
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,301
(Endless Conspiracy Theories Student Council President Missing?)

the student council president went missing.

71
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,429
(The Reason for the General Student Council's Week-Long Silent Treatment?)
But just a few days ago, the student council president went missing.

72
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,975
It's most likely due to
her disappearance that

73
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,810
so many districts have been experiencing conflict.

74
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,731
Speaking of the General Student Council...

75
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,900
...Um, what was it called again?

76
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,904

between Trinity General School

77

79
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,909
Yes, exactly!

80
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,494
Has that been signed yet?

81
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:15,125
The student council president
was the one facilitating the peace talks,

82
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,669
so it's unclear what will happen.

83
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,588

N-No! It's nothing...

91

With the student council president missing,

96
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,415
they're likely too busy to deal with us.

97
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,420

- Right...

but it was so hot I got heatstroke
while walking out in the sun,

146

179
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,383
The five of us make up

180
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,886
the Abydos Foreclosure Task Force.

181
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,513
Nice to meet you.

182
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,139
Nice to meet you too.

183
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,350
Oh geez, Serika.

184
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,519
Be more gentle with this old-timer, please.

185
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,020
What nonsense are you spouting?!

186
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,148
You're the president,
and you need to act more like one!

187
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,193
Oh... Takanashi Hoshino here.

188
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,778
Pleasure to meet you.

189
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,447
I'm Sensei, from Schale!

190
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,490
The pleasure's all mine.

191
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,079
- Hey, Sensei.
-Hm?

192
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,999
I'll take you on a tour.

193
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,884
The desertification in Abydos
Is worse than I thought.

194
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,885
Is it?

195
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,347
(Cycling Club/Now Recruiting)
It's been like this

196
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,725
ever since I enrolled.

197
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,687
I haven't seen any other students here.

198
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,523
Is it just the five of you?

199
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:35,732
(School Office)

200
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,108
(School Office)
Yes.

201
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:37,775
(School Office)

202
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,860
(School Office)
The truth is,

203
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,402
The truth is,

204
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,696
this school is in severe debt,

205
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,240
and so everyone left. Except us.

206
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,536
The Foreclosure Task Force has been
taking on whatever jobs we can

207
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,372
and repaying the debt bit by bit.

208
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,791
That must be difficult for you.

209
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,378
The gym needed to be cleaned
a little while ago...

210
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,549
But Ayane was sick,
so the four of us had to do it.

211
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,887
It was pretty hard. There was
more trash than we expected.

212
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,430
We still finished in the end though.

213
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,975
And then Ayane scolded all of us.

214
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,518
She was mad?

215
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,730
What's this room for?

216
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,440
It's not used for anything right now.

217
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,652
But this is your room
from now on, Sensei.

218
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,946
- Really? For me?
- Mhm.

219
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,532
The regular office is
overrun with sand.

220
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,662
Is this too small for you?

221
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,040
It's more than enough. Thank you.

222
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,791
Okay.

223
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,053
Shiroko, why do you want
to protect this school?

224
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,473
Gunshots?!

225
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,517
A message for Abydos High School!

226
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,646
Today's the day we're finally
going to conquer your territory!

227
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,440
Huh? The Kata-Kata Helmet Gang?!

228
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,690
(Please Use Sparingly!)

229
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,734
(Please Use Sparingly!)
Now? Of all times?!

230
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:06,280
Oh geez.
I really just wanted to have a nice, peaceful nap.

231
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,450
I'll drive them away like I always do!

232
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,454
Everyone! Let's go protect our school!

233
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,833
Stay here, Sensei.

234
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,167
Shiroko?!

235
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,047
Watch out!

236
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,592
Thank you, Arona.

237
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,804
You're welcome, Sensei!

238
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,058
Here, Shiroko.

239
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,643
Thanks.

240
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,646
How tiresome.

241
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,817
We're rather low on ammo.
What a pickle.

242
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,445
If only our new supplies were here...

243
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:46,737
I see no problem.

244
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,573
Shiroko! Wait!

245
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,371
Give it up already!

246
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,208
We know you're
low on ammunition!

247
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,627
Huh?! How'd they know that?

248
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,254
Don't worry, Ayane.

249
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,257
They're no match for us anyway.

250
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,468
<i>—</i> Shiroko's creating cover for us.
<i>—</i> Yes!

251
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,181
We'll never hand over Abydos High School
to the likes of you!

252
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,894
Shiroko?!

253
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,355
Shiroko! Nonomi!

254
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,316
Hoshino!

255
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,527
Everyone! Retreat for now!
We'll regroup!

256
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,865
They're running around
like chickens with their heads cut off!

257
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:34,702
We were right!
They're down to their last bullets!

258
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:39,123
It'll be a fight to the finish!

259
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,835
Just how I like it! We'll take them all down in one go!

260
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,133
Sensei, if this continues much longer,
the Abydos students will...

261
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,553
Let's go!

262
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,142
Is everyone okay?

263
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,436
We're fine. We can still fight.

264
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,898
We can't let them pin us down like this!
We need to spread out.

265
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,275
Hey, hey. Are you guys seriously still trying?

266
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,653
You don't stand a single chance against us!

267
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,905
Take this!

268
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,785
We can't handle
much more of this!

269
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,038
Damn it! How did we
get cornered by those losers?!

270
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,876
Everyone!

271
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,421
Huh? Who's that?

272
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,180
Why is it important to you
to protect this school?

273
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,265
Sensei.

274
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,100
Why?

275
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,985
Because...

276
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,572
this school

277
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,824
is where we belong.

278
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,952
Is that how everyone feels?

279
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,954
Of course!

280
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,208
Who the hell is this,
swooping in like some hero?!

281
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,918
You can call me Sensei.

282
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,128
Sensei?

283
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,132
I'm here to help my students.

284
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,510
Sorry, but I have to ask you to leave
this school's property.

285
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,305
You think you can talk down to me like that?!

286
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,265
I'll shoot you to pieces!

287
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,475
Let's go, everyone.

288
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,690
Nonomi, lay down suppressive fire!

289
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,525
Roger!

290
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,363
Serika, take aim!

291
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,532
Damn it! Where are they?!

292
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,825
Just stay calm?

293
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,454
I would've done that
even if you didn't tell me!

294
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,248
Nice job, Nonomi, Serika!

295
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,916
What's happening?!

296
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,001
Don't think that you?

297
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,839
This old-timer can't look bad
in front of her youngins!

298
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,977
Coordinates confirmed.

299
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,688
Catch, Shiroko!

300
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,400
Nice timing, Ayane.

301
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,113
Don't underestimate me!

302
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,285
Hey, get a grip!

303
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,163
Eek! How embarrassing!

304
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,088
Hey!

305
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,467
Don't come any closer!

306
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,636
Deliver the final blow, Shiroko!

307
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,680
I said stay back!

308
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,562
W-W-W-W-Wait! I-I surrender!

309
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,106
It's over.

310
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,532
Ow, ow! That hurts!

311
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,242
Please, no! Augh! It hurts!

312
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,369
Then leave. Now.

313
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,788
Okay, okay! I'm leaving! I'm gone!

314
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,920
We'll get revenge one day!

315
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,799
We won, Shiroko!

316
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,093
Well done!

317
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,972
We really managed to
turn the tide there.

318
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,932
All thanks to Sensei's help.

319
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,601
Not at all. I didn't do anything.

320
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,062
It's my job as a teacher

321
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,274
to help my students in their time of need.

322
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,403
Hmph. We would've beat them
on our own anyway.

323
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,865
Bashful as always, Serika.
Don't be so stubborn!

324
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,116
Sh-Shut up!

325
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,118
Our little Serika is so adorable.

326
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,828
You're putting on such a tough front!

327
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,997
Stop it already!

328
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,917
So, this is...Sensei.

329
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,979
(He seems like a good guy./Sensei?/
Yeah. He seemed okay./I thought so too.)

330
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:12,855
(But let's not jump to any conclusions.)

331
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:35,252
The sky blue archive!

332
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:48,098
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

333
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:52,311
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

334
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,607
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

335
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,361
Those clouds like whales are always changing

336
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,490
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

337
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:09,870
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

338
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,124
If I were here alone, here without all of you

339
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,128
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

340
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,172
A fateful coterie

341
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:28,097
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

342
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:37,022
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

343
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:42,862
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

344
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:53,998
Because this is the only place where we belong

345
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,568
Strawberry milk...

346
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,491
Hi, Arona.

347
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,959
I've been waiting for you, Sensei.
