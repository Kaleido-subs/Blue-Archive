1
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,391
So you've successfully reclaimed
the Schale building, Sensei

2
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,727
Only thanks to everyone's hard work, Rin

3
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,563
Then, would you please follow me?

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,987
This is where we store the student council
president's personal effects

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,659
Take this, Sensei

6
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,161
A smart tablet?

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:40,207
The student council president left it for you

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,917
The Shittim Chest

9
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,380
Its OS and system structure
are complete mysteries

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,424
None of us were even able to activate it

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,177
Perhaps you can discover its secrets

12
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,484
Castella cake:---

13
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:12,072
Banana milk goes better---
than strawberry milk---

14
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,332
Huh? Wha? Ah?!

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,210
If you're here in this space,
does that mean you're---?!

16
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,337
- Are you--
- That's right

17
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,548
I'm Sensei, from Schale!

18
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,053
Calm down, calm down!

19
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,763
Well, uh--

20
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,640
Ah, right!

21
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,269
My name is Arona!

22
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,315
I'm the system manager in the Shittim Chest
and I serve as its main OS.

23
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,319
Think of me as your trusty secretary!

24
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,070
It's nice to meet you, Arona

25
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,698
Yeah! It's nice to meet you too,

26
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,866
Sensei!

27
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:01,371
The sky blue archive!

28
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,176
I pedal on my bike seeking new sights

29
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,388
We'll break the monotony,
no longer trapped in place

30
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,726
Daydreaming on the rooftop,
gazing at a sky so blue

31
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,396
Those clouds like whales are always changing

32
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,609
We'll embrace a past that can't be altered

33
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:35,989
Sharing juice in this world made of sand
Is a taste so divine

34
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:40,243
If I were here alone, here without all of you

35
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:44,289
I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry

36
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,291
A fateful coterie

37
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:54,257
Even if the world's memories blow away
like grains of sand one day

38
00:02:54,424 --> 00:03:03,225
The sky, sea, wind, and you,
our youth will never end

39
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:08,980
It's easy to see why we protect what we do

40
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:20,075
Because this is the only place where we belong

41
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,419
- Run!
Out of my way!

42
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,379
- Help!
- Retreat!

43
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,798
Well done, everyone

44
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:39,469
That's another Helmet Gang outpost
we've dismantled

45
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,263
Right

46
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,557
Well done, Sensei!

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,892
Ah, thank you, Arona

48
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,733
Phew, I'm exhausted---
These old bones need a nap

49
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,067
Oh dear!

50
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,611
You all ready to head back to school?

51
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,738
- Yeah!

52
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,785
Now that we've taken down

53
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,746
(Foreclosure Task Force Daily Meeting) the
Helmet Gangs nearest base of operations,

54
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,831
(Foreclosure Task Force Daily Meeting)
they'll be forced to lay low for a while

55
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,875
It's all thanks to you

56
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,210
You were the ones who did all the work!

57
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,628
Don't be so humble---

58
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,339
The Sensei of Schale is on
a whole 'nother level

59
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,844
Now we can focus on repaying our debt

60
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,181
Right, your debt---
How much do you owe, exactly?

61
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,892
Oh, 900 million or so?

62
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,685
9-900 million?

63
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,898
962,350,000 yen, to be precise

64
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,901
How did you end up in such a massive hole?

65
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,615
---Decades ago,

66
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,658
there was a massive sandstorm

67
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,119
in the desert surrounding Abydos

68
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,581
The power of that sandstorm was devastating

69
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,126
Parts of Abydos were completely buried in sand

70
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,963
The school had to raise a lot of funds
for disaster relief---

71
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,717
but there wasn't a single bank that would
approve such a large loan

72
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:05,931
So the school was forced into the arms of
some loan sharks called Kaiser Loans

73
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:11,311
They thought they would be able to pay
the money back quickly---

74
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,271
But---

75
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:19,069
The sandstorms only worsened
as the years went on

76
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:23,615
and now more than half of Abydos has
disappeared beneath the sand

77
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,451
As the debt ballooned with each storm,

78
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,247
the students began to despair

79
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,749
If the academy can't repay its debt,

80
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,085
the loan sharks will foreclose on us

81
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,046
They'll shut down the school

82
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,051
But our chances of repaying that
much money are almost zero

83
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,847
The other students gave up---
They left the school a long time ago

84
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,059
That's why we're the only ones left

85
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,106
Well, we shouldn't bore you with old stories

86
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,695
Thank you for sharing this with me

87
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,366
I'm starting to understand what
you've been going through

88
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,286
This huge debt may feel overwhelming:---

89
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,289
But you're right not to give up!

90
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,832
How about this---

91
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,420
I'm your Sensei now, so we're in this together
Can I help you out?

92
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,879
Do you mean—

93
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,966
Yes! Thank you so much!

94
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,968
How is that okay?

95
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,930
This "Sensei” is a complete outsider

96
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:33,643
But that's why he can help us
Maybe he can see something we haven't tried

97
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,020
So what?!

98
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,399
We've been dealing with the school's
problems on our own!

99
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,694
Why are we taking orders from
some adult we don't know?

100
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,530
I just want to help you out

101
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,490
Stop looking down on us!

102
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,036
I don't accept your help!

103
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,413
Serika!

104
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,918
They're all so stupid!

105
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,753
"Sensei, Sensei!"

106
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,262
(Hoshino: We can take it a little more easy now)
(Ayane: I agree with what Shiroko said!)

107
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,805
(Hoshino: Eager as ever, Ayane)
(Ayane: Let's keep up the hard work!)

108
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,098
(Besides, whatever we say now--+)

109
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,901
What's wrong with Sensei?

110
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,445
After school yesterday:---

111
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,949
Hey, Serika! Heading home?

112
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,081
Hey, Serika
Maybe we could drop by a cafe and chat?

113
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,126
H-Hey S-Serika---

114
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,252
C-Can we talk for a second?

115
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,463
Go away, you stalker!

116
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:49,511
You know that would have annoyed anyone,
let alone Serika, right?

117
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,721
Speaking of -

118
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,557
Have you noticed that Serika always leaves
right after school?

119
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,101
Where does she go?

120
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:00,230
And she only responds in MomoTalk
late at night, too--:

121
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,773
That's right

122
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,025
Say, everyone---

123
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,862
Why don't we secretly trail Serika
after school today?

124
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,323
I'm in!

125
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,159
Good morning

126
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,638
The target has passed point A.

127
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,640
Tracking target

128
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,101
I have her in my sights

129
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,111
Swapping hounds

130
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,821
Understood

131
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,699
Please stay on her trail

132
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,799
This is---

133
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,926
(Shiba Seki Ramen)
Shiba Seki Ramen?

134
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,262
That reminds me

135
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,973
The Ramen there is delicious

136
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,685
(Shiba Seki Ramen)

137
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,187
(Shiba Seki Ramen)
Thank you!

138
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,397
Tasty as always!

139
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,359
Master, I'm back for more!

140
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,737
Serika isn't coming out

141
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,448
Think she signed up for an eating contest?

142
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,202
I'm hungry, Want to go inside and see?

143
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,620
- Sure
- I'm in!

144
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,917
Hey, welcome!

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,543
Welcome, how many—

146
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,713
Wow, Serika!

147
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,049
That uniform's so cute!

148
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,175
You guys---

149
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,011
Are you Serika's classmates from Abydos?

150
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,306
Since you're here to support her,
I'll give you a free meal on the house!

151
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,935
W-Well, everyone

152
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,479
This way---please

153
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,566
Serika, did you take this job
for the cute uniform?

154
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,736
Enough! Just order already!

155
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,654
- Miso Ramen
- Beef Ramen

156
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,739
One at a time!

157
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,742
What about you, Sensei?
Order what you want!

158
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,827
All right---

159
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,579
Ah, well, I'll---

160
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,125
Well---

161
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,255
Thank you for the food!

162
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,429
So how'd you like my Ramen?

163
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,181
It's so good!

164
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,724
Of course it is!

165
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,102
But it's great to meet Serika's friends!

166
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,396
Your shop seems to be doing pretty well

167
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,941
Nah, business has really dried up lately

168
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,026
S-Sorry

169
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,237
Ah, there's no helping it

170
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,323
So long as one hungry soul
steps through my door,

171
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,784
I'll serve them the best Ramen
in the world!

172
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,036
That's the motto of my shop, at any rate

173
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,665
That's amazing!

174
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,709
Master, I'll learn from your example

175
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,503
and do my best to help these students!

176
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,463
Oh, you're not half bad, Sensei!

177
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,340
- Please come again!
- I'll make an exception

178
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,009
and give you one more bowl on the house!

179
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,724
Serika! See you in the morning!

180
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,227
- Goodbye
- Good Ramen, good life

181
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,272
They really gave me a shock:---

182
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,857
(Shiba Seki Ramen)
They really gave me a shock:---

183
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,234
(Shiba Seki Ramen)

184
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,825
Serika, go ahead and
hang up your apron now

185
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,951
All right!

186
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,707
- Oh---Serika?
- Yes?

187
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,711
It's nice to see an adult
with his students at heart

188
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,505
That's how I feel

189
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,677
--I'm going to head out now

190
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,279
Good work today, Heading home?

191
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,122
That master is an amazing Ramen cook---

192
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,208
And I think he's a good person

193
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,002
He seems dependable

194
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,671
Yeah---

195
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,554
- You know, Serika---
-Hmm?

196
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:48,851
I think Sensei is the same way
I trust him

197
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,734
Night, Serika, See you tomorrow

198
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,616
For the master and Shiroko
to say the same thing---

199
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,287
That Sensei---

200
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,708
Can we really rely on him?

201
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,961
No, that's impossible!

202
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,921
After everything Abydos has gone though---

203
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,554
What is this?!

204
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,480
What? Are you joking?

205
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,566
Serika is missing?

206
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:40,278
Yes, She didn't answer her door this morning

207
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,864
I was worried, so I went inside

208
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,409
But her uniform and bag were gone!

209
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,411
What about her phone?

210
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,039
She didn't pick up any of my calls

211
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,291
Don't tell me that last night---

212
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,335
Hold on a minute, everyone

213
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,468
The sea is where the soul resides

214
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,513
<i>—</i> Ah, welcome back, Sen—
<i>—</i> Arona!

215
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,681
Can you do me a favor?

216
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,184
It's urgent
Please locate Serika!

217
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,187
O-Okay!

218
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,232
I know where Serika is!

219
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,526
Huh? How?

220
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,946
I accessed the General Student Council's
central network

221
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,990
and tracked the location of
Serika's cellphone!

222
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,700
You have the authority to do that?

223
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,577
That doesn't matter, Where is Serika?

224
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,580
It looks like she's on the move

225
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,083
The desert outside the city?

226
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,501
She's moving towards

227
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:40,671
one of the Kata-Kata Helmet Gang's hideouts!

228
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,425
Are they trying to force our hand
with a hostage?

229
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,511
We can't waste time chatting

230
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,846
We need to rescue Serika now!

231
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,806
Right

232
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,308
Hold on a moment!

233
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,450
Where am I?

234
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,327
Is this a truck?

235
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,039
Have I been kidnapped?

236
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,002
Are they driving through the desert?

237
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,797
Transport team, reporting in

238
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,675
Kata-Kata Helmet HQ, do you copy?

239
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,386
This is Kata-Kata Helmet HQ.

240
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,389
Transport team, what's taking you so long?

241
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,391
We don't have long until we're discovered

242
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,144
We'll be caught if you delay!

243
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,522
Don't worry, we'll be there
in about ten minutes

244
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,066
Fine, just hurry it up!

245
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,025
Copy

246
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,987
I have to escape!

247
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,781
Please!

248
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,450
What should I do?

249
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,077
Everyone must be so worried

250
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,665
Are they dragging me off to
bury me somewhere?

251
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,251
Everyone!

252
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,253
I wish you were here!

253
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,511
What?!

254
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,060
Nice going, Shiroko!

255
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,605
Head straight for Serika!

256
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,691
Ayane, where did you find this truck?

257
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,611
It was collecting dust in the
school warehouse

258
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,530
I didn't think it would ever come in handy

259
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,283
Hold on!

260
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,176
Stop her!

261
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,681
What's happening? What's going on?

262
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,353
Serika's here, with tears in her eyes

263
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,938
Serika!

264
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,067
Poor Serika
Cute kids shouldn't be left alone

265
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,109
Stop it!

266
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,237
Don't cry, Serika

267
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,781
We're here to wipe away your tears

268
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,616
I'm not crying!

269
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,536
Serika, it's a relief to hear your voice

270
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,829
S-Sensei? Why are you here too?

271
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm a stalker, remember?

272
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,416
Wh-What?

273
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,294
Don't tease me at a time like this!

274
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,380
You're all so mean!

275
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,841
All right, everyone,
you know what to do next

276
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:31,842
Yes!

277
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,970
Let's counterattack!

278
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,349
Follow them!

279
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,355
No more dirty tricks!

280
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,357
No more mercy!

281
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,239
You'll have to aim better than that!

282
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,868
This is what you get for kidnapping me!

283
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,748
If your gun won't work:---

284
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,381
You did it, Shiroko!

285
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,216
A-Ayane, watch out!

286
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,933
We got their car!

287
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,728
Try playing hide and seek now!

288
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,938
Sensei, are you all right?!

289
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,107
Y-You saved me

290
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,359
Let me handle this!

291
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,993
Take this!

292
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,670
Your bullets are nothing to our tanks!

293
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,505
They're tougher than I expected

294
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,841
Wait, everyone—I have a plan!

295
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,594
Stop cowering! Come out here!

296
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,806
You'll need to move together

297
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,516
What do you think?

298
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,977
Yes, I like it!

299
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,271
It's worth a shot!

300
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,482
I'll watch your back!

301
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,692
We're counting on you, Serika

302
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,445
Yes, I won't let you down!

303
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,239
We're ready now

304
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,742
Move to your positions!

305
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,370
Understood

306
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,915
You can't escape us!

307
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,793
Now, Ayane

308
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,419
Okay!

309
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,133
I told you it was useless!

310
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,678
Just give up and surrender already!

311
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,237
Done playing cat and mouse?

312
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,280
Get your hands in the air!

313
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,205
10, 9, 8,

314
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,625
7,6,5,

315
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,586
4, 3, 2,

316
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,587
11

317
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,464
Now, Serika!

318
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,391
N-No way!

319
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,941
Run away!

320
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,153
- Just you wait!
- You'll regret this!

321
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,534
Wish you never kidnapped
me now, don't you?

322
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,748
We won by the skin of our teeth

323
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,708
Great job, everyone

324
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,294
You too, Sensei!

325
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,464
Our Sensei's truly wise beyond his years

326
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,757
N-No way!

327
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,052
We really taught the Helmet Gang
a lesson this time

328
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,180
Yes, definitely

329
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,769
Thank you, Serika

330
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,690
Don't thank me!

331
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,860
I would have escaped on my own
without you!

332
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,362
And I could have handled the Helmet Gang
by myself!

333
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,157
But, still--

334
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,911
Y-You rescued me, so---

335
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,498
Thank you, Sensei!

336
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,085
Ah, little Serika's shy

337
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,129
N-No I'm not!

338
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,965
- You sure?
- I said no!

339
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,134
Youngins are never honest with themselves

340
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,970
- But that's why you're so cute
- Enough!

341
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:07,409
I'll take a window seat on this journey to find
the place where my heart belongs

342
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,165
So I can see beyond this sorrow chasing me

343
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,796
We were losing track of time without ever knowing why

344
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,799
With all those laughs we shared:---

345
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:28,138
Even if---those moments were just ordinary

346
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,974
Those days---

347
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,477
One more time, one time more,

348
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,981
Knowing they won't come around again!

349
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,526
If only I could stay as resolute and beautiful

350
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,196
As the moon hanging in the bright noon sky

351
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,825
Would that let me finally forgive

352
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,287
All those regrets we made so willfully?

353
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,623
We only recognize the important things

354
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:58,794
Once they're gone and lost out of sight

355
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,339
We stretch up to the moon in the bright noon sky

356
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:06,719
Even though it will always be beyond our reach

357
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:11,932
Oh, those unforgettable, beautiful days---

358
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,032
Wh-Who are you people?

359
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,243
We are Problem Solver 68!

360
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,038
And we'll do the crime---

361
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,874
---if you've got the dime!
