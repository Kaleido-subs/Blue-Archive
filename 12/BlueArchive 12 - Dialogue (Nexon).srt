1
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,093
Confirmed it!

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,096
This facility perfectly matches

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,933
the intel Sensei provided

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,643
Thanks, Ayane

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,103
Hoshino is in there⋯

6
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,939
Everyone, are you ready?

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,482
- Yes
- Yeah

8
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,280
Back then,

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,743
Hoshino held her hand out to me

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,247
So this time, I will⋯

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,919
Wait for me,

12
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,879
Hoshino

13
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,807
You're in my way!

14
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,809
Get out of here!

15
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,647
What's going on? You bastards!

16
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,024
Do you know who
you're messing with?

17
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,822
Of course

18
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,703
It really is impossible to gain entry

19
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,122
anywhere besides the main gate

20
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,000
But we're not getting anywhere like this either

21
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,045
Shiroko!

22
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,215
Get them!

23
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,140
- Nice, Nonomi
- No problem!

24
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,270
50% of the interception unit eliminated!

25
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,188
Field support requested!

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,523
We have no choice

27
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,191
Send reinforcements!

28
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,069
We must stop them at all costs

29
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,113
The gate's opening!

30
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,449
But there are more enemies now

31
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,494
We're breaking through

32
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:00,412
What?!

33
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,291
It's true we'll never advance
if we don't do something⋯

34
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,043
But it's too dangerous!

35
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,171
"Don't worry
You'll have my back,”

36
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,506
Isn't that right, Shiroko?

37
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,383
Yes

38
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,472
As expected of Shiroko⋯

39
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,974
You're always so reckless

40
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,685
It's quiet

41
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,605
- Did they retreat?
- No way

42
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,815
They can't have

43
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,945
- Go!
- Yes!

44
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,781
Stop her!

45
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,246
Oh no, Close the gate!

46
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,456
Not a chance

47
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,002
What?!

48
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,389
Damn it!

49
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,016
We have an emergency! Please respond!

50
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,726
Intruders have infiltrated the base

51
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,895
I repeat, we have an emergency!

52
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,147
- Intruders have infiltrated the base!
- They broke through?

53
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,358
Where is the director?

54
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,902
Report the situation!

55
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,778
Y-Yes, sir!

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,531
Intruders have breached the main gate

57
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,075
and are currently inside the base!

58
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,744
Damn those annoying remnants

59
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,247
of Abydos High School!

60
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,456
What should we do?

61
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,126
How many troops are ready
for immediate deployment?

62
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,670
Only units 3 through 5, sir!

63
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,171
What about the rest?

64
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,716
They're still recovering from the last battle

65
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,009
Useless bunch

66
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,220
I'll double-check just in case

67
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,558
He's got a lot of nerve
after wrecking that prototype

68
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,227
Seriously, I'm amazed
he's still talking like that

69
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,645
Idiot, he can hear you!

70
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,147
Damn it

71
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,150
<i>And we can't pull back
he northern units right now</i>

72
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,901
Should we contact headquarters?

73
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,070
No! I'll handle it!

74
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,655
U-Understood

75
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,783
I've got something!
The situation is as I reported,

76
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,244
but we've finished production on the new weapons

77
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,746
Good, Deploy them immediately!

78
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,748
Send out units 3 through 5 too!

79
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,293
That would leave us defenseless here

80
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,169
Is that all right?

81
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,003
It doesn't matter!

82
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,714
We must stop them at all costs!

83
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,886
Where is Hoshino?

84
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,019
This is Unit 3! Deploying drones!

85
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,812
The other ones aren't ready yet?!

86
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,355
They're still being calibrated!

87
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,733
Hurry up! We can't
hold out much longer!

88
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,869
Are the calibrations still not done?

89
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,039
This is Command Center!
Launch is authorized!

90
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,341
They're like the one from last time⋯!

91
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,593
But there are so many of them!

92
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,096
How long can you hold
out with so few people?!

93
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,853
What was that?

94
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,563
Um⋯!

95
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,357
It's me

96
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,859
- Ah, Hifumi—
- You're wrong!

97
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,028
It isn't Hifumi,

98
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,030
but Faust

99
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,742
Th-That's why you're wrong!

100
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,452
I'm not Hifumi,

101
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,913
and I just happened to be passing by

102
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,041
Those aren't Trinity General School
grenade launchers or anything,

103
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,669
and I don't even know who fired that shot

104
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,256
And those students over there
have nothing to do with this either!

105
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,840
I-Is that so?

106
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,426
Thank you very much, dearest Faust!

107
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,136
Sure

108
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,098
All right everyone,
if you will!

109
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,522
They've managed to⋯
Regardless, charge forward!

110
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,399
Do you think you can win like that?

111
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,152
You bastards are from Gehenna⋯

112
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,737
Well, well

113
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,574
You still think numbers are everything?

114
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,950
Sorry to keep you waiting

115
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,244
The Prefect Team⋯!

116
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,539
Command Center,
requesting reinforcement

117
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,333
- Director, what should we do?
- I repeat, requesting reinforcement

118
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,793
Since it's come to this,

119
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,005
deploy all our weapons!

120
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,216
Crush them with our full force!

121
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,304
Make them regret ever challenging us

122
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,181
Iori, drone unit at 2 o'clock!

123
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,891
Got it, Ako

124
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,519
We arrived just in time

125
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,979
You are⋯

126
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,733
The enemy will likely
come for us at full force

127
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,693
Let's take them down!

128
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,987
All right, Everyone, let's go!

129
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,113
- Yeah!
- Understood!

130
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,991
Please get out of the way!

131
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,124
Take a nap for a bit

132
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,838
I can't lose either

133
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,883
- Go up from there!
- Yes!

134
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,722
Perfect

135
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,898
- I'll leave it to you
- Got it

136
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,567
- Ready to drop
- Here we go

137
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:36,790
Futile

138
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,086
Here we go!

139
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,677
We'll hold them here

140
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,930
You're going to save
Takanashi Hoshino, right?

141
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,306
-Yes
-Yes

142
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,685
Remaining firepower is 50%!

143
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,021
- What should we do now?
- It's impossible

144
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,940
With our remaining power, it's just impossible

145
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,944
Y-Yes, sir

146
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,904
Director, headquarters is calling

147
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,198
Don't transfer it to me! Ignore it!

148
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,075
Then⋯what should I tell them?

149
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,536
Director! Another reinforcement request from the field

150
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,414
- What?!
- Director! Units 3 through 5 were wiped out

151
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,833
Remaining firepower is 30%

152
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,710
- What should we do?
- Director!

153
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,547
- We can't hold out any longer
- Give us an order!

154
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,258
- Where are the reinforcements?
- We're out of time

155
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,097
Sir, you need to respond⋯

156
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,643
All right

157
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,105
I'll crush them with my own two hands

158
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,150
I'll handle this myself!

159
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,366
This place⋯

160
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,870
This is a blackboard, right?

161
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,371
Y-Yeah

162
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:02,333
There's a whole lot of familiar objects here⋯

163
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,753
Is this a school?

164
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,130
In the middle of a desert?

165
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,594
Could this possibly be⋯?

166
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,722
Yes! Just as you suspect

167
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,017
This is the main building of

168
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,977
the previous Abydos High School

169
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,520
You⋯!

170
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,815
You just persist and persist, huh,

171
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,984
Abydos Foreclosure Task Force?

172
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,779
We're here to take back Hoshino

173
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,490
Do you plan on interfering with us forever?!

174
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,658
Move aside, or else!

175
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,203
Foreclosure Task Force

176
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,372
You've always been a thorn in our side

177
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,335
Despite using every possible
method at our disposal,

178
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:51,424
you've obstinately clung
to that collapsing school,

179
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,928
desperately working to repay its debt

180
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,889
Even though we harassed you so much⋯

181
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,433
Even though we tried to
crush you again and again,

182
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,436
how do you continue enjoying
yourselves day after day?!

183
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,939
You guys are ruining my plans!

184
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,983
My plans!

185
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,528
Do you really think we'd give in

186
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,655
to your evil, crude tactics?

187
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,116
Give us Hoshino

188
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,367
We won't lose!

189
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,954
We'll never lose to a pathetic
adult like you! Never!

190
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,249
I can't let you interfere a moment longer

191
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,710
I need to find it as soon as possible

192
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:31,506
I don't know what you're
trying to find, but move aside!

193
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,594
Try to make me if you can

194
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,763
Not again

195
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,851
Looks like you're in trouble, hm?

196
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,726
Huh?

197
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,022
Yoo-hoo!

198
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,649
E-Excuse us

199
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,193
Problem Solver 687!

200
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,363
Showing up in a crisis like this

201
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,824
is what makes us hard boiled outlaws

202
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,538
Sorry! This thing's gonna fall

203
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,875
What did you saaay?!

204
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,259
Um⋯

205
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,845
You bastards⋯

206
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,847
This guy still⋯

207
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,764
Huh?

208
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,561
We took time out of our
busy schedule to come help

209
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,980
You only pretended
to refuse for the drama

210
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,773
You don't need to tell them that!

211
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,194
Aru is kind, after all

212
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,113
A-Anyway⋯

213
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,326
Leave this to us
You guys keep pushing forward!

214
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,539
I actually said it!

215
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,584
I think I'm falling for you, Aru

216
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,336
Y-You're so cool

217
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,047
I'll follow you forever, Aru

218
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,132
Let's go

219
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,300
- Yeah
- Okay

220
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,219
I-I won't thank you now

221
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,430
But when this is all over,

222
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,849
let's go get Ramen together

223
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,937
- We'll repay this favor
- Thank you!

224
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,360
Good luck!

225
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,577
We have no choice now

226
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,955
Oh my, what a coincidence

227
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,500
Hey, Kayoko
What's with that face?

228
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,544
- It's nothing
- We came to help

229
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,505
Is anyone hurt?

230
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,715
We just need to take that thing down?

231
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,634
W-Wait a moment!

232
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,553
I'll help too

233
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,013
Damn it!

234
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,392
How dare they all get in my way!

235
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,771
This is getting interesting, Aru

236
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,648
All right, Shall we?

237
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,817
Yes

238
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,069
The ones you'll be facing⋯

239
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,407
are us!

240
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,001
I wonder what the kids
are doing right now

241
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,629
I disappeared without a word

242
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,631
Do they hate me?

243
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:20,300
(Contract)

244
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,175
(Contract)
In the end,

245
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:21,342
(Contract)

246
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,887
(Contract) my contract with
Kaiser Corporation was worthless,

247
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,432
and Abydos was attacked

248
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,769
I finally did something,
but it amounted to nothing

249
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,278
Was there⋯some other way?

250
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,615
After everything, it was my
bad choice that brought harm

251
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,326
to both the city and the school

252
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,792
Nonomi⋯ Are you still smiling?

253
00:13:55,918 --> 00:14:00,131
You always invited me on shopping trips,

254
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,759
never deterred by my refusals

255
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,845
You lifted me out of my gloomy days

256
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,933
Back then, you made me so happy

257
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,896
Serika

258
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,440
You're usually so diligent and strict,

259
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,986
but you'd always come wake
me up when I'd fall asleep at school

260
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,155
If you didn't have to work,

261
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,492
you'd even stay and wait for me to wake up

262
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,995
That clumsy kindness of yours

263
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,081
kept me going

264
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,417
Ayane

265
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,921
You've led the kids in my stead,
covering for my incompetence

266
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,758
and working hard to
solve our money problems.

267
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,386
(Debt Repayment Plan) You're the reason
the Foreclosure Task Force still exists

268
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,846
You're the reason the Foreclosure
Task Force still exists

269
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,934
And⋯Shiroko

270
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,311
You had no memories,

271
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,606
and you knew nothing of this world,

272
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,275
so I always thought it was
me looking out for you

273
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,237
When did it become
the other way around?

274
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:09,075
What you said at the aquarium
made me so, so happy

275
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,994
Because of each of you,

276
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,456
I got to enjoy an unburdened school life,

277
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,626
continuing to move forward no matter what

278
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,339
Thanks to you, I was able to smile

279
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,969
in the place Yume left for us

280
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,431
But that'll be gone soon too, won't it?

281
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,726
All because of my bad choices

282
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,773
Would I be here if I'd faced
our problems head on?

283
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:45,528
If I'd managed to figure it out
before being tricked by an adult,

284
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,365
would the situation be different now?

285
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,245
I wasn't good enough, I couldn't find a solution

286
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,291
And I solved nothing in the end

287
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,545
If I had just made the right choice,

288
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,549
then I'd never have experienced this pain

289
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,885
The school,

290
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,595
the kids,

291
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,847
Yume⋯

292
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,852
It's all my fault, every last bit of it

293
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,688
Why did I make all these mistakes?

294
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,733
Why couldn't I have just been
honest and relied on them?

295
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,485
Everyone cared about me so much

296
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,614
I'm sorry, Shiroko

297
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,079
Wh-Wh-What did you do?!

298
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,168
- Since it's come to this⋯
- Wait!

299
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,878
What on earth are you doing?

300
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,005
A-Are they going to be okay?

301
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,841
- Tch, What the hell?
- Everyone⋯

302
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,721
Hurry, Foreclosure Task Force

303
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,433
What was that shaking just now?

304
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,728
- Not our problem, Let's go!
- Yeah

305
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,793
Everyone

306
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,176
Hey, Hoshino

307
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,013
You know, when I first met you,

308
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,016
I had to pinch my cheek a bunch of times

309
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,977
because I thought I was dreaming

310
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,730
Having a cute, strong,

311
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,316
dependable junior like you by my side

312
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,653
really felt like a dream, I was so happy

313
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,779
Okay?

314
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,534
Maybe I'm not explaining it well,

315
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:00,037
but getting to be by your side,

316
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,040
it feels like a miracle to me

317
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,878
Day after day, we're always together

318
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,631
Yesterday, today, and
tomorrow are all the same

319
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,801
That's just the way of things,
so what's the big deal?

320
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,262
Still!

321
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,973
Miracles are supposed
to be something amazing

322
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,975
and rare, aren't they?

323
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,435
No

324
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,022
I don't think that's quite right, Hoshino

325
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,065
What're you even saying?

326
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,026
You know, Hoshino

327
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,821
Someday you'll have a cute junior too

328
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,573
When that time comes⋯

329
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,453
Yume,

330
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,372
I've been so foolish

331
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,335
I had to be put in this
situation to finally understand

332
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,881
I'll never make this mistake again

333
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,677
I don't want to make
this mistake ever again

334
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,598
Because to me, the real miracle is

335
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,976
my Foreclosure Task Force juniors!

336
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,988
Nonomi

337
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,907
Serika

338
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,825
Ayane

339
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,661
Shiroko

340
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,413
I⋯

341
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,226
Is that⋯?

342
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,543
Shiroko⋯?

343
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,502
Yes

344
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,258
Where are we?

345
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,011
Huh? How did I⋯

346
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,431
I was sure that I⋯

347
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,974
It was close

348
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:25,933
Huh?

349
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,982
I see

350
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,525
You kids⋯

351
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,110
Sensei⋯

352
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,945
An adult⋯

353
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,450
Geez! Do you know
how worried everyone was?

354
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,994
Sorry

355
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:45,911
W⋯

356
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,289
Welcome back, Hoshino

357
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,916
Ah! No fair, Serika!

358
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,335
And you said you couldn't say
embarrassing stuff like that

359
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,880
Shut up, Who cares!

360
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,507
- Hoshino
- Huh?

361
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,259
Welcome back

362
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,636
Hoshino! Welcome back

363
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,388
Welcome back

364
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,683
Welcome back, Hoshino

365
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:17,318
You were right
Those words have so much warmth,

366
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,652
Yume

367
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,578
You all look so expectant now

368
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,206
Do you really want to hear me say it?

369
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,751
What the heck! If you know,
don't drag it out!

370
